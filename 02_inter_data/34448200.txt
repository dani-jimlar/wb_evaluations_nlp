2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   The project development objective (PDO) was to strengthen the capacity of the Bangladesh Bureau of
   Statistics (BBS) to produce high quality core statistics and make them accessible in a timely manner to policy
   makers and the public. For this Review, the objectives are parsed as follows:

       1. Increase the capacity of BBS to produce high quality core statistics.



                                                                                                   Page 1 of 15

c. Will a split evaluation be undertaken?
   Yes

d. Components
   1. Improving the Coordination and Management of Statistical Activities. (US$1 million at appraisal,
   US$0.376 million at closure*). This component aimed at improving coordination among the different
   agencies in charge of collecting statistics and improving the statistical management systems of the BBS.
   This implied the signing of several Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) between the BBS and different
   government agencies on data collection and data sharing, and the identification of areas where
   improvements were needed to enhance coordination.

   2. Developing Human Resources and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
   Infrastructure to Produce and Manage Data. (US$5 million at appraisal, US$4.663 million at closure*).
   This component aimed at enhancing the training capacity of BBS by strengthening the Statistical Staff
   Training Institute and developing a training policy to systematize training for BBS staff.

   3. Improving the Coverage and Quality of Core Statistics Required for Policy Making, (US$7 million at
   appraisal, US$6.208 million at completion*). This component aimed at improving the design,
   implementation, and information generated by core priority indicators represented by national accounts,
   price statistics, social statistics, and agricultural statistics by creating an enabling environment through
   strengthening coordination mechanisms and regulations, and by improving management systems and both
   human and physical capital.

   4. Promoting and Strengthening Access and the Use of Official Statistics (US$0.8 million at appraisal,
   US$0.435 million at completion*). This component aimed at improving access to official statistics and
   metadata for government officials and the public by implementing a dissemination policy, providing wide
   access to statistical products, and enhancing user-producer dialogue.

   5. Project Management (US$1.2 million at appraisal, US$1.418 million at closure*). This component aimed
   at supporting the establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in order to ensure proper project


                                                                                                   Page 2 of 15

   implementation and coordination, effective monitoring and evaluation of results, and a consistent and
   effective approach to achieve the project objectives.

   * Note: Since the exchange rate between BDT and US$ varied significantly during project implementation
   (from BDT82.9 per US$ at project approval to BDT119.5 per US$ at project closure), the value of project
   cost at closure reported above has been estimated by using an average exchange rate of BDT to US$ of
   87.43.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
   The project's cost at appraisal was US$15 million. Of that amount, US$13.1 million was actually disbursed.
   No reason is given in the ICR for the undisbursed share. The project team explained offered the explanation
   that the discrepancy was due to exchange rate fluctuations. When the project was approved in 2018, the
   exchange rate was BDT82.9 per US$. The exchange rate increased over the implementation period to
   BDT117.50 per US$ at project closing. Neither the overall project amount in BDT was revised nor the ceiling
   changed by the government.

   The closing date was extended three times, and while the components were not changed, the
   implementation schedule and results framework (RF) were revised in the second and third restructurings.
   The first restructuring in March 2020 (US$2.72 million disbursed) extended the closing date from February
   28, 2022, to August 31, 2022. This was deemed necessary because of the slow progress made by the
   project as consequence of delays in hiring short-term consultants for the PIU and delays in procuring the
   Twinning Partner (TP).

   The second restructuring in September 2021 (US$7.41 million disbursed) extended the closing date of the
   project from August 31, 2022, to June 30, 2023, and introduced changes to the RF. The date extension was
   due to the onset of COVID-19 which caused delays in implementation. Changes to the RF were made to
   adjust indicators measuring improvements in core statistics, the number of core statistics and surveys to be
   supported, and the end target for releasing key core statistics, because of uncertainty caused by the
   pandemic.

   The third restructuring in January 2023 (US$9.74 million disbursed) extended the project’s closing date from
   June 30, 2023 to February 27, 2024. It also introduced changes to the RF, specifically to intermediate-level
   indicator 4: "Mechanisms are put in place to enhance coordination." This change replaced the "National
   Statistical Coordination Committee" with the "National Advisory Committee on Statistics (NACS)" to secure
   support from a higher authority and ensure ministerial representation.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Strong economic growth in Bangladesh during the period prior to this project contributed to a reduction of
poverty. Poverty incidence (measured by US$1.90 per capita per day, in 2011 Purchasing Power Parity)
declined from 44.2 percent in 1991 to 13.8 percent in 2016. Despite these development achievements,


                                                                                                   Page 3 of 15

                                      Bangladesh NSDS Implementation Support (P157987)



               Bangladesh remained one of the poorest countries in South Asia, with limited public services and
               comparatively weak institutions.

               As part of its Seventh Five Year Plan (FY16–FY20), the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) committed to
               achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and to monitoring progress towards
               the achievement of these goals through the timely availability of reliable statistics for evidence‐based
               planning and policy making. The GOB had taken several steps to improve the availability, quality, and
               reliability of statistics. Between 2007 and 2009, the BBS initiated several reforms to improve the coverage
               and quality of statistics in key areas. Later, in 2010 and 2011, it prepared the first National Strategy for the
               Development of Statistics (NSDS), which mapped out a development path for the National Statistical
               System (NSS). In 2013, the GOB approved the NSDS and the Statistics Act, which envisaged the creation
               of a professional and efficient NSS with the ability to produce high quality and up-to-date official statistics in
               a transparent and timely manner. The NSDS was implemented over the period from 2013 to 2023.

               The PDO was aligned with the Bangladesh 7th Five Year Plan and with the Country Partnership Framework
               (CPF, FY16-FY20) and continued to be relevant to the CPF at closing (FY23-FY27) and the GOB strategy
               for the development of statistics. The FY2023-2027 CPF recognized the importance of a national statistical
               system to design, monitor, and evaluate development programs, and highlighted the importance of and the
               critical support the Bank can provide to strengthen the quality and reliability of official statistics. Under CPF
               Objective 3, the Bank planned to help the BSS to improve the availability, accessibility, frequency, and
               quality of official statistics. The 2021 Systematic Country Diagnostic Update emphasized the need to build
               effective and efficient institutions and the need to build strong statistical capacity in order to support
               evidence-based policy reforms. The project objectives were also aligned with the NSDS 2013-2023, the 8th
               Five Year Plan, the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100), the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan and its
               Nationally Determined Contribution, and the Perspective Plan for Bangladesh 2021-2041 (PP2041), all of
               which called for the production and dissemination of high-quality official statistics to inform policy making.

               The project was aligned with the Bank's corporate goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
               prosperity.

To achieve this objective the project focused on two activities: a) creating an enabling environment by
strengthening coordination mechanisms and reviewing by-laws and regulations, and b) improving BBS’
management systems, human capital, and physical infrastructure.

The Results Chain (RC) was clear (ICR, p. 9 and annex 5 p. 34), although at times the distinction between
outputs and outcomes is not clear. It started by describing the three main challenges to the production and
distribution of high-quality official statistics. They are represented by: first, the presence of an enabling legal
and institutional environment in which the statistical system can conduct its activities, with such an
environment improved by updating statistical legislation, policies, and institutional arrangements; second, a
proper BBS organization and production process, which can be addressed by strengthening BBS’
management systems, improving its human capacity, and its ICT infrastructure; and third, an appropriate
user‐producer dialogue that encourages the usage of statistics, which can be improved with an appropriate
dissemination policy, the production and dissemination of appropriate metadata and microdata, and relevant
training courses for data users. Taken together, these outputs would have been expected to result in
enhanced capacity of the BBS to produce and disseminate high-quality data.

The key challenges were correctly identified, although one additional challenge was not included in the results
chain: the need for clear career growth opportunities for professional statisticians. The lack of such
opportunities has the potential to undermine staff morale and push them to leave the national statistical
system, compromising the capacity built by the project.

One PDO-level indicator and four intermediate-level indicators were used for this objective. All indicator
targets were achieved.

      PDO Indicator 1: Core statistics are improved in line with international standards. Seven out of
       eight (87.5 percent) identified core statistics were improved in line with international standards and
       best practices. Through a Twinning Partner, BBS leveraged international expertise across various
       statistical domains. Core statistics were deemed improved if predefined improvement needs were
       addressed, including methodological enhancements, the development of manuals, piloting new
       approaches, and providing training. The baseline was 0 percent (2018), the target was 50 percent
       (2024), and the actual was 87.5 percent (2024) (ICR, p. 11). At the second restructuring, this indicator
       was changed from “core statistics" broadly defined, to “survey/data under 8 core statistics," since
       these were the set of core statistics regularly produced by the BBS on consistent intervals. This
       revision merely made the indicator more precise and did not represent a material change or a change
       in scope. (PDO Indicator 1: achieved).
      Intermediate Indicator 1: Mechanisms are put in place to enhance coordination. Five MoUs were
       signed and are operational. The NACS was formed, and five meetings were held. The baseline was
       having meetings on an ad-hoc basis, the target was four MoUs and two meetings (2018), and the
       actual was five MoUs and five meetings (2024) (ICR, p. 13). (Intermediate Indicator 1: achieved).
      Intermediate Indicator 2: Conducting assessments and training for better management
       systems. A functional review of BBS was conducted, and its Implementation Plan was approved.
       Staff trained included 15 officers on financial management and 40 on public procurement. The
       baseline was no functional review and limited financial management and procurement capacity; the
       target was a functional review completed with an implementation plan approved, and at least 4 staff
       trained on financial management and 40 on public procurement (2018); and the actual was a
       functional review conducted, implementation plan approved, 15 staff trained on financial management,
       and 40 staff trained on procurement (2024) (ICR, p. 12). (Intermediate Indicator 2: achieved).

      Intermediate Indicator 3: Investments in ICT infrastructure to support data collection and
       management. An ICT and Roadmap (including an implementation plan) was prepared and approved.
       The baseline was an inadequate ICT infrastructure; the target was an ICT plan completed (2018); and
       the actual was an ICT Plan and Roadmap prepared and approved (2024) (ICR, p. 12). (Intermediate
       Indicator 3: achieved).
      Intermediate Indicator 5 [1]: Implementation of training policy to develop human resources.
       Around 6,455 BBS officials were trained (17.8 percent female officials), and two courses for other
       government officials, and two courses for media personnel, were conducted. The baseline was
       training conducted ad hoc; the target was 500 BBS staff trained (10 percent women), two training
       courses delivered to government officials, and two training courses delivered to the media (2018); and
       the actual was 6,455 BBS officials trained (17.8 percent female officials), two courses delivered to
       other government officials, and two courses delivered to media personnel (2024) (ICR, p. 12).
       (Intermediate Indicator 5: achieved).

These were appropriate indicators to measure capacity to produce high-quality statistics. Hence, this
objective was substantially achieved.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Increase the capacity of BBS to make statistics accessible in a timely manner to policy makers and the public
(original outcome targets)

Rationale
To achieve this objective, the project focused on four activities: a) introduce an effective and clear
dissemination policy, b) release core statistics according to a pre-defined calendar, c) anonymize and make
accessible core surveys' microdata, and d) increase user satisfaction. The RC described under Objective 1
plausibly connected these activities to the outcome of increased accessibility of statistics in a timely manner.

Three PDO-level indicators and one intermediate-level indicator were used to measure this objective. Two of
the three PDO-level indicator targets were achieved, and the intermediate-level indicator target was also met.

      PDO Indicator 2: Core statistics are released according to a pre-defined calendar. Four out of
       eight core statistics were conducted, and the data and reports were made available on BBS’s new
       website according to a pre-defined calendar. The baseline was no formal release calendar was in
       place (2018), the original target was 80 percent of the core statistics disseminated on time as
       announced in the release calendar (2024), and the actual achievement at project closing was 50
       percent of the selected core statistics released according to a calendar available on BBS website
       (2024) (ICR, p. 11). (PDO indicator 2: not achieved under the original outcome target).

      PDO Indicator 3: Core surveys' microdata anonymized and made accessible. Five core surveys’
       microdata were anonymized and made accessible. The baseline was 0 percent (2018), the target was
       40 percent (2024), and the actual was 100 percent of the five surveys (2024) (ICR, p. 11). At
       restructuring, this indicator was changed from “all microdata of all core statistics” to “microdata of five
       core surveys identified for anonymization and accessibility," to align the target with the five core
       surveys that were expected to be carried out during the project’s lifetime. This revision merely made
       the indicator more precise and did not represent a material change or a change in scope. (PDO
       Indicator 3: achieved).
      PDO Indicator 4: Increased user satisfaction. Two User Satisfaction Surveys (USS) were
       conducted, showing an increase in user satisfaction. The baseline was no formal strategy to gather
       users’ satisfaction (2018); the target was 50 percent of indicators in the USS show improvement in
       user satisfaction compared to baseline (2024); and the actual was 84.6 percent of indicators on
       satisfaction of use of official statistics show improvement (2024) (ICR p. 12). (PDO indicator 4:
       achieved).
      Intermediate Indicator 4: Introduction of an effective and clear dissemination policy. A Data
       Dissemination Policy covering guidelines on data sharing was prepared and approved by BBS
       management, and it was approved by the Statistics and Informatics Division (SID) of the Ministry of
       Planning. The baseline was no formal dissemination policy in place (2018); the target was approval of
       a dissemination policy for core statistics (2024); and the actual was a formal dissemination policy
       prepared and approved by BBS management and by SID for operationalization (2024) (ICR, p. 12).
       (Intermediate indicator 4: achieved).

These were appropriate indicators to measure increased capacity of BBS to make statistics accessible in a
timely manner to policy makers and the public. With the key outcome target on timely dissemination of key
statistics not achieved (PDO Indicator 2), achievement of this objective under the original outcome targets is
rated Modest.

OBJECTIVE 2 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
Increase the capacity of BBS to make statistics accessible in a timely manner to policy makers and the public
(revised outcome targets)

Revised Rationale
PDO Indicator 2: Core statistics are released according to a pre-defined calendar. At the project's
second restructuring, the target was revised from 80 percent to 40 percent to be more realistic and feasible
within the project’s lifetime, given early implementation challenges, delays in securing government funding
approval, and initial lack of an approved pre-defined calendar. Four out of eight core statistics were
conducted, and the data and reports were made available on BBS’s new website according to a pre-defined
calendar. The baseline was no formal release calendar was in place (2018), the revised target was 40
percent of the core statistics disseminated on time as announced in the release calendar (2024), and the

    5. Efficiency
   According to the ICR, a cost-benefit analysis was not undertaken because it is not possible to assess the
   benefits of a public good, such as the production, analysis, and dissemination of official statistics to inform
   development policy decisions.

   The efficiency of the project is instead judged on its ability to improve the quality, cost, and availability of official
   statistics compared to previous practices. The delivery of training to improve BBS staff capacity to conduct large-
   scale statistical operations following international standards resulted in improved quality of the data collected.

                                                                                                                                Page 8 of 15

The use of modern data collection technologies, such as computer-assisted personal interviewing, and the
conduct of refresher trainings enhanced fieldwork logistics. This represents a significant improvement in
efficiency compared to the earlier, paper-based data collection system. The upgrading of office facilities, ICT
equipment, and software also contributed to enhanced processes and monitoring of data collection and
shortened the release time of results, with survey results disseminated within one to three months after data
collection. All these factors contributed to cost and time efficiencies in data collection.

Survey implementation experienced some delays in: (a) setting up the PIU, (b) obtaining Cabinet Committee on
Government Purchase approval on the main contract with the joint venture Twinning Partner (TP) firm; and (c)
travel disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, implementation proceeded
smoothly, supported by strong government ownership and the strong skills and ability of the project’s
implementation team.

6. Outcome

According to harmonized IEG/OPCS guidelines, the overall outcome rating of a restructured project is
determined by weighting the amount of Bank financing that disbursed before and after the restructuring. At the
2021 restructuring that revised the outcome target, US$7.41 million, or 56.6 percent of Bank funds (7.41/13.1),
had been disbursed.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The ICR identified three potential risks to the development outcomes of this project: (1) the need for
sustained political support from the GoB to establish and maintain the legal, administrative, and budgetary
frameworks required for producing and disseminating high-quality official statistics; (2) challenges related to
institutional capacity for effective implementation and sustainability, including fiduciary management; and (3)
the potential duplication of efforts among development partners.

The risk to the development outcome is considered low, as the improvements in capacity and infrastructure,
combined with the increased availability of reliable statistics, are expected to sustain demand for high-quality
core statistics. Additionally, the NSDS 2024–2030 and a proposed public sector operation, which includes a
significant focus on data and aims to strengthen the capacity of the NSS and the BBS, demonstrate
continued government and development partner commitment to sustaining and advancing the project
outcomes.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The technical design of the project was not discussed in the ICR’s section on quality at entry. However,
  the project team elaborated to IEG that the project’s technical design was guided by the priorities outlined
  by the NSDS 2013–2024 and was informed by intensive consultations with staff and management of the
  BBS, other relevant government agencies, and donors. The project’s design was in line with international
  good practices as recommended by the Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century, an
  initiative that aimed to promote better production and use of statistics throughout the developing world.
  The production, processing, and dissemination of high-quality data followed international best practices
  and were based on survey manuals and operational guidelines. The process involved investing in

                                                                                                     Page 10 of 15
     Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)                              Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Review
     Bangladesh NSDS Implementation Support (P157987)



  management skills, strengthening coordination across agencies, and developing regulations that allowed
  for a strong NSS and the modernization of BBS’ ICT infrastructure.

  According to the ICR, several indicators adopted "international standards" and "international best
  practices," such as the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM), General Activity Model of
  Statistical Organizations (GAMSO), and the UN National Quality Assurance Framework as benchmarks
  to measure the achievement of objectives. In line with the identified challenges, the project supported the
  modernization of BBS’ ICT infrastructure and produced several manuals, such as a glossary that served
  as a user-friendly ready reference for statistical personnel, to remove ambiguity and misconception by all
  users of statistical data (ICR, p. 9).

  The Bank conducted a thorough risk assessment at appraisal and implemented several mitigating
  measures. To help reduce the risk of low implementation capacity of BBS staff, the project adopted
  several strategies, including entering into twinning arrangements with a consortium of experts, which
  provided training on financial management, procurement, and other technical areas.

  However, the project design showed several shortcomings. First, the implementation unit was not ready
  to hire key personnel as planned due to the steps needed for BBS to hire international consultants.
  Second, the project lacked clarity in defining key terms, including what constituted "core" statistics, how
  they related to "core surveys," and the specific "users" of the statistics. This ambiguity necessitated
  further definition of key indicators during project restructurings. Third, there was no initial pre-defined
  calendar for release of core statistics, resulting in ambiguity on PDO indicator 2 to release statistics
  according to such a calendar, and eventually requiring downward revision of the target for that indicator.
  Finally, the project did not adequately address the potential risk associated with the lack of clear career
  growth opportunities for professional statisticians. The project team noted to IEG that establishing clear
  career growth paths for BBS staff required institutional reforms that were outside the scope of the project.



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 According to the ICR, the Bank team conducted regular supervision and implementation support missions,
 as evidenced by 12 Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). Key team members, including the
 Task Team Leader and other project staff, were based in the field, facilitating close supervision and support
 during project implementation. The team conducted three implementation support missions per year from
 2018 to 2024, along with a mid-term review mission. This support allowed the team to discuss and resolve
 issues raised during implementation. The task team also demonstrated flexibility by adapting to changing
 circumstances, such as switching to virtual missions due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19
 pandemic.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The project included appropriate indicators to monitor progress towards achieving the PDOs. The M&E
 design and RF were well-structured, allowing for effective tracking of progress. The results framework
 included indicators aligned with project components and objectives, facilitating measurement of outcomes,
 though there was lack of clarity in several of the indicators as initially defined, requiring later revisions (see
 Section 8a). The annual implementation plans, prepared by the PIU and approved by the BBS Director
 General, were integrated into the M&E design, providing a detailed list of activities, timelines, and outputs.



b. M&E Implementation
  The ICR indicates that the M&E system was effectively implemented, with regular data collection and
  analysis supporting informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. Every six months the task
  team, PIU, and TP conducted an implementation supervision mission, updated the RF, and identified
  issues and actions to undertake to ensure the proper implementation of the project. Each mission
  highlighted key implementation challenges and provided updates on all issues, recommendations, and
  progress on actions agreed in previous implementation support missions through Aide
  Memoires/technical notes.

  The financial management and procurement specialists hired by the PIU and the Bank's fiduciary team
  were part of the implementation support team to ensure reporting and auditing activities as well as
  compliance with the Bank's procurement, disbursement, and financial management procedures. The
  Project Steering Committee (PSC), headed by the SID Secretary, included representatives from the
  Ministry of Finance, other government agencies, and the BBS. The PSC helped ensure that
  implementation followed both government and Bank rules and procedures and provided overall policy
  guidance.



c. M&E Utilization
  The six-month progress reports, ISRs, and management letters and project team follow-ups were
  regularly and effectively used to discuss the implementation status of the project. The project
  team shared with IEG that the PIU prepared periodic progress reports every six months and discussed
  those reports with the project team in order to monitor implementation. The technical consultants – from
  a Twinning Partner that included a consortium of experts who provided broad technical support for the
  project - also provided separate periodic progress reports every six months. The PIU also hired a project
  economist and ICT experts who provided expertise and supported the preparation of project progress
  reports by focusing on the project's M&E system and the RF. Following each implementation support
  mission, the project team provided Aide Memoires, management letters, and other documents, and



                                                                                                        Page 12 of 15

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   No environmental safeguard or social policies were triggered by this project, since it focused only on
   capacity building and data collection activities. It was rated Environmental Assessment category C.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   The project utilized the Bank's Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP) tool, a planning
   and tracking system used to monitor procurement activities, identify benchmarks, and measure
   performance. STEP was also employed to record all contracts, deliverables, invoices, and payments.
   Activities approved in the Procurement Plan during implementation were executed smoothly without any
   issues, with competitive bidding being the preferred method for awarding contracts.

   Fiduciary risk, initially assessed as high, was later downgraded to moderate due to appropriate training
   provided to key staff on financial management and procurement. To address identified procurement risks,
   the PIU hired a procurement consultant and collaborated closely with the Bank's procurement specialist.
   Additionally, the project engaged a Twinning Partner to provide most of the technical assistance required
   for project activities.

   As a result, the project demonstrated consistent compliance with financial management requirements. This
   included the regular submission of acceptable financial reports and disclosures, efficient budget
   management of government and Bank funds, and the timely submission of audit reports. Proactive
   measures were taken to resolve audit observations, ensuring robust financial oversight throughout the
   project.




c. Unintended impacts (Positive or Negative)
   BBS completed collaboration agreements with several agencies, such as Statistics Korea, the US Census
   Bureau, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Office of National Statistics in the United Kingdom, the
   Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, and Oxford Policy Management. Further, the project
   team supported the preparation of the next NSDS (2024-2030) through extensive national level dialogue,
   field consultations, and expert review.

12. Lessons

As a lesson, the ICR highlights that to prevent delays in implementation, the costs of a PIU must be
properly budgeted, and the PIU should be granted the authority needed to approve activities. This
can be accomplished by strategically positioning the PIU within the national statistics office and
establishing an internal prior approval mechanism based on agreed workplans and budget.

IEG adds that establishing an enabling environment through legal and regulatory frameworks for the
production and dissemination of core official statistics is critical to developing and sustaining
statistical capacity for evidence-based policymaking. The enabling environment should align with
international standards and support the independent production and use of official statistics.

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR provided a general and impartial account of the project's design, implementation, and achievement of
its objectives, largely adhering to established guidelines. However, in several areas, the ICR could have
included more evidence to substantiate its claims. Additional evidence had to be gathered from ISRs, Aide-
Memoires, and interviews with the project team. Some data were missing, such as the baseline and target
years for the indicators and the actual disbursement amounts for each component. In certain instances, the ICR
lacked accuracy. For example, paragraphs 22–23 did not acknowledge the revisions to the outcome targets,
and paragraph 79 described the indicators as "very clear," despite the fact that the concept of "core" statistics
and surveys was not defined until several years into implementation.
