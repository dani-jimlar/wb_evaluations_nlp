d. Components
   The project, structured as an Investment Project Financing (IPF), featured two main components: Technical
   Assistance (TA) and Results-based Financing (RBF) utilizing Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs).

   Component 1: Technical Assistance (Appraisal: US$31.70 million, Actual: US$18.58 million): Under
   Component 1, specialized TA was provided to strengthen Assam Right to Public Services Act (ARTPS)
   implementation, support process re-engineering in selected services, establish Public Facilitation Centres
   (PFCs), and foster citizen engagement. Reimbursement of eligible expenditures followed the World Bank's
   procurement guidelines and was contingent upon the submission of interim unaudited financial reports
   (IUFR).

   Component 2. Results-based Financing (Appraisal: US$7.50 million, Actual: US$13.50
   million): Component 2 focused on bolstering reform processes related to timely delivery of public services
   under ARTPS, expanding service access, particularly in Sixth Scheduled tribal districts, increasing notified
   services under ARTPS, and incentivizing results orientation. Notably, the results-based approach was
   significantly bolstered, with financing for this component increasing from 19% to 42% of the project size,
   resulting in an increase in DLIs from four to seven, and recalibration of DLI targets. Disbursement occurred
   upon the achievement of DLIs and reporting of Eligible Expenditure Program (EEP).

   The Project underwent three restructurings to adapt to evolving needs, capitalize on exchange rate gains
   and cost savings, and accommodate changes in the implementation schedule. These restructurings
   involved the following adjustments.

        1. Restructuring No. 1: 29 November 2019 – Level 2 restructuring which led to changes in Financial
           Management. The changes sought to replace the earmarking of specific Government of Assam’s
           (GOA) Head of Expenditure in the EEP to a DLI with a global link of the DLIs to the overall EEP as
           defined and to facilitate the disbursement of DLIs.
        2. Restructuring No. 2: 01 July 2021 – A level 2 restructuring led to several revisions as follows:
                a. Change in components and cost: Savings of US$8.12 million was identified under
                   Component 1 due to delayed implementation. Of this amount, US$2.12 million was
                   cancelled, and the remaining US$6 million was reallocated from the TA to the RBF. The
                   revised cost components were US$18.6 million for Component 1 TA (compared to US$31.7
                   million) and US$13.5 million for Component 2 RBF (compared to US$7.5 million).
                b. Cancellation of financing: Total loan cancellation of US$7.12 million was executed from the
                   TA component, taking the total cost to US$32.1 at project restructuring. This included the
                   cancellation of US$5 million was on account of exchange rate gains, and US$2.12 million as
                   in (a) above due to cost savings and delayed implementation.
                c. Reallocation between disbursement categories. US$6 million was reallocated from the TA to
                   the disbursement linked categories (RBF).
                d. Change in results framework: DLI#2: Inclusion of 1,500 accredited Common Service
                   Centers (CSCs), to reflect the growth in service access points and thereby revising PDO
                   indicator-2 to read as 'Operational Facilitation Centers comprising PFCs and CSCs to serve
                   as points of access for ARTPS Services'. The target and values associated with existing

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 16

    Assam Citizen-Centric Service Delivery (P150308)



                DLI#4 were raised to include notifying a total of 185 citizen centric public services under the
                ARTPS Act. In addition, to the enhancement of DLI targets, three new DLIs were
                added. The three additional DLIs aimed to: (i) incentivize making available RTPS services
                online on the ARTPS Portal; (ii) sustain and reinforce GoA’s policy reform initiatives for
                improved public service delivery within the ambit of amended ARTPS Act; and (iii) encourage
                better compliance of time-bound service delivery under RTPS. DLI#5 was added to
                incentivize the integration and onboarding of these RTPS services through the ARTPS Portal
                as a single window access for citizens. DLI#6 was added to incentivize effective functioning
                of the Appellate mechanism for the RTPS, and would involve: (i) facility for citizens to file
                RTPS appeals through online Appeal Management System; (ii) framing of rules, procedures
                and regulations for efficient disposal of appeals; and (iii) robust penal provisions in the event
                of delinquency or failure. DLI#7 was added to incentivize improvement in the delivery of
                select ARTPS services within the stipulated time.
      3. Restructuring No. 3: 10 May 2022 – Several changes as follows:
             a. Change in Loan Closing Date: The final restructuring extended the project period by one year
                to 30 June 2023. This was to compensate for initial delays and time lost due to Covid-19
                related lockdowns and completion of all intended project activities to facilitate the attainment
                of the PDO.
            b. Change in Results Framework: The Results Framework was adjusted to reflect the extended
                implementation period of six years (2018-2023). The end targets for most of the indicators
                remained unchanged. The RF matrix was updated only to reflect the annual target for the
                extended period. The end targets for two intermediate results indicators (IRIs) were revised:
                IR#1 (RTPS ICT platform is operational) and IRI#6 (improved processes for targeted
                services in Government departments).
             c. Change in Implementation Schedule: Adjustment to the disbursement estimates to reflect
                full disbursement of US$32.08 million during the extended implementation period.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  Project Cost: The total project cost was estimated at US$49.0 million. The actual cost was US$40.1 million
  or 81.8% of the appraisal estimate, (ICR p. 2).

  This variance was influenced by exchange rate gains, savings due to delayed implementation and
  reallocation between components (see restructuring above). These adjustments collectively contributed to
  the reduction in the project's total cost.

  Financing: The project was financed through an IBRD loan of US$39.0 million. The actual amount
  disbursed was US$32.08 million.

  Borrower Contribution: The Borrower was expected to contribute US$9.8 million. The Borrower actually
  contributed US$8.02 million.

  Dates: The project was approved on 26 May 2017. It became effective on 11 August 2017,
  approximately 2.6 months later. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) review was conducted on 27 June 2020. The
  project closed on 30 June 2023. The project duration from its effectiveness on 11 August 2017 to its closure
  on 30 June 2023 was approximately 5 years and 10 months.

3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Context at Appraisal: Assam, with a population of 31 million, shared socioeconomic characteristics with
other low-income Indian states. Despite its rich cultural diversity, Assam grappled with challenges such as
susceptibility to natural disasters and historical ethnic tensions. However, the late 1980s brought about a
period of sustained political stability, laying a foundation for development initiatives.

Assam's public service delivery system was marked by inefficiencies, limited accessibility, and a lack of
user-friendly interfaces between citizens and government agencies, (ICR, p. 5). Outdated manual
processes hindered operational efficiency, while frontline institutions lacked a citizen-centric approach.
Geographical barriers and communication constraints in certain regions imposed significant costs and
delays on citizens seeking government services. Additionally, Assam faced challenges in broadband
connectivity (below the district level), inadequately developed ICT infrastructure for service delivery across
the Government of Assam (GoA). While efforts under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) aimed to
establish a statewide ICT network, reliable connectivity remained scarce beyond the district level.
Moreover, essential ICT infrastructure such as the State Data Center and the State-Wide Area Network
(SWAN) operated below optimal capacity, necessitating comprehensive upgrades for efficient service
delivery through digital means.

In 2012, GoA adopted the ARTPS to ensure citizens' easy and affordable access to public services in an
accountable manner. Although conducive policy and institutional contexts were facilitated by the enactment
of the ARTPS, weak institutional capacity, poor inter-departmental collaboration, and changes in
Government posed challenges in swiftly moving ahead with effective RTPS implementation.

Given these circumstances, improving the delivery of public services through digital means was deemed
critical. This involved expanding the reach and ease of service access, establishing digital processes for
tracking compliance with ARTPS, and strengthening service delivery institutions to facilitate equitable
citizen access to services. Such measures aimed to enhance the overall citizen experience and promote
transparency and accountability in public service delivery.

Previous Bank Experience: The Bank has implemented prior capacity building programs in India, as well
as Assam, using Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agriculture Services Society (ARIAS), as its implementing
agency in Assam, (PAD, p. 64).

Consistency with the Bank Strategies: The PDO aligns closely with the World Bank's (WBs) priorities in
India, as outlined in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY 2018-22. A key focus area identified in
the CPF was "strengthening public sector institutions," which was integral to achieving the PDO. Through
WB support, the GoA was able to revamp and digitize service delivery processes, enhance service
accessibility, establish digital tracking mechanisms for compliance with Right to Public Services (RTPS)
regulations, address demand-side considerations, and fortify service delivery institutions, thus ensuring
equitable access to services for citizens. These interventions are also aligned with two other strategic areas
highlighted in the CPF: (a) engaging with different levels of government in India to drive positive change at

               the state level; and (b)fostering service delivery innovations and knowledge exchange, particularly across
               North-east India.

               Alignment with Government Reform Strategies/Priorities:The PDO is in line with the reform priorities of
               the Government of India (GoI) and GoA. In addition to empowering citizens to demand timely services, the
               ARTPS framework provides avenues for addressing grievances arising from service delivery deficiencies or
               denials. The Prime Minister of India has consistently underscored the crucial role of efficient digital service
               delivery on numerous occasions. Moreover, the 'Strategy for New India@75' outlined by NITI Aayog
               emphasizes the imperative of strengthening public institutions and administration to enhance the availability
               and accessibility of e-services, aligning with GoI's developmental objectives for FY 22-23. Additionally, the
               GoA has set an ambitious target of achieving round-the-clock online delivery of all government services by
               2026 through comprehensive digitization efforts across departments.

               Summary of Relevance of Objectives Assessment. The PDO was pitched at an appropriate level of
               ambition, given the significant challenges faced by Assam's public service delivery system. The PDO was
               strongly aligned with Bank strategies, the reform priorities of the GoI and the GoA.

               Therefore, Relevance of Objectives is rated High.

                             Rationale
                             The project did not initially incorporate a Theory of Change (ToC) within the PAD. However, the ICR
                             subsequently reconstructed a credible ToC aimed at addressing the challenges of public service delivery in
                             Assam. These challenges, encompassing complex administrative procedures, outdated processes, and
                             limited digitization, were compounded by geographical and connectivity constraints.

                             To comprehensively tackle these obstacles, the ToC delineated a series of strategic activities. Primarily, it
                             aimed to strengthen policy frameworks and extend the RTPS legislation to tribal districts, thereby expanding
                             the scope of digitally accessible services. Additionally, efforts were directed towards overhauling
                             departmental mechanisms through digitalization and streamlining service processes for enhanced efficiency.
                             Moreover, the ToC included activities such as implementing a user centric ARTPS Portal and multi-channel
                             service delivery strategies to ensure inclusive access. Furthermore, comprehensive information campaigns
                             and the establishment of grievance redress mechanisms were prioritized.

These interventions were anticipated to yield immediate outputs, such as simplified processes and improved
digital access, paving the way for intermediate outcomes like enhanced service delivery efficiency and
heightened citizen satisfaction. Ultimately, the overarching objective, as articulated in the PDO statement,
was to ensure improved citizen access to public services in Assam. While critical assumptions were not
explicitly outlined in the ToC, it was assumed that the extension of services to Tribal districts would be
effective, and that the Tribal districts would agree to proposed changes, facilitated by political buy-in and
cooperation.

Intermediate Results and Outputs:

The following key outputs were reported in the ICR (Annex 1, p. 21):

IRI#1: RTPS ICT Platform is operational: The multilingual ARTPS Portal was officially inaugurated in
October 2021, and established to serve as gateway for online access of 310 RTPS services. By exceeding
notification goals and achieving high compliance rates with service delivery timelines, the project contributed
to strengthening governance mechanisms and regulatory compliance. The notification of a total of 119
services by Sixth Schedule Autonomous Councils and the notification of 310 services under the Assam RTPS
Act reflect improved transparency, accountability, and adherence to service standards. This outcome
underscores the project's commitment to enhancing governance practices and ensuring regulatory
compliance in public service delivery. (Baseline: Detailed project report and implementation plan to be
approved by GoA; Annual Service Delivery Report based on MIS published. Revised target: Stabilization of
RTPS portal, with RTPS MIS and performance monitoring mechanism in place). Achieved.

IRI#2: Access to RTPS Services expanded to targeted districts: at the end of the project, the Sixth
Schedule Autonomous Councils had notified a total of 119 services under the RTPS. Access to RTPS
Services was expanded to targeted districts, surpassing notification goals. (Baseline: 0.00;
Target: Notification of total 90 RTPS services in the targeted districts). Achieved.

IRI#3: Number of Services notified under RTPS Act: Cumulatively 310 services had been notified under
the Assam RTPS Act at the end of the project. (Baseline: 55 RTPS services initially notified; Original target: A
total of 95 services were notified; Revised target: cumulatively 185 services were notified. Achieved.

IRI#4: Number of applications for RTPS with women as beneficiaries: at the end of the project, more
than 2.0 million women had drawn benefits of RTPS services, representing 27% women service recipients of
total service applicants (Baseline: 20% of applications with women beneficiaries; Original target: Increase of
22% over baseline; Revised target: 42.5% of total applications for RTPS with women as beneficiaries.
Partially Acheived.

IRI#5: Number of online services available at the ARTPS Portal: the ARTPS Portal provided citizens’
access to 310 RTPS services at project completion date. More services have been onboarded to the Portal
following the closure of the project. This IRI was added at Restructuring No. 2: Target: make cumulatively 95
services available. Achieved.

IRI#6: Improved processes for targeted services in Government departments: Through initiatives such
as business process reengineering for targeted services, the project aimed to optimize processes and
enhance operational efficiency. The successful completion of process improvements for 146 services
indicates a higher-level outcome of streamlined service delivery processes. By eliminating redundant steps

and implementing end-to-end digitalization, the project contributed to improved efficiency and effectiveness in
the provision of public services. Achieved.

IRI#7: ARTPS Policy framework and institutional mechanism strengthened: Establishment of Grievance
Redressal Mechanism which was operational at the end of the project. The project's implementation of a
grievance redressal mechanism plays a pivotal role within the broader framework of improved governance
practices and citizen-centric service delivery. By operationalizing this mechanism, citizens are empowered to
voice their concerns and seek resolution for issues encountered during their interaction with RTPS in Assam.
With more than 39,000 grievances and 1,100 RTPS appeals resolved, the project ensures transparent and
accessible channels for submitting complaints and feedback. This is likely to foster a culture of accountability
and responsiveness, bolstering public trust in government institutions and services. Additionally, the
continuous monitoring and analysis of grievances contribute to process improvement and efficiency, ensuring
that service delivery remains responsive to citizen needs and expectations. Overall, this mechanism
significantly boosts citizen engagement, trust, and satisfaction, aligning with the project's overarching goal of
enhancing efficiency and transparency in public service delivery. Baseline: ARTPS Act 2012 enacted and
ARTPS Rules 2012 framed; Target: Grievance Redress mechanism for the ARTPS is operational online.
Achieved.

IRI#8: Compliant ARTPS applications related to 10 most availed services delivered within timeframe
prescribed by ARTPS Act: at the end of the project, complied with notified service delivery timelines was
ensured for 70 percent of the application for 10 most availed RTPS services. Achieved.

IRI#9: Increase in RTPS beneficiary feedback on service delivery: -improved Citizen-Centric Service
Delivery- The project's emphasis on citizen engagement and satisfaction, as evidenced by the
operationalization of beneficiary feedback mechanisms and grievance redressal mechanisms (as discussed
above) underscores a higher-level outcome of citizen-centric service delivery. The recorded high satisfaction
levels and positive feedback from citizens (with a recorded 95% satisfaction level, and 4.2 out of 5 rating in
citizen satisfaction) reflect an increased focus on meeting citizen needs, enhancing service quality, and
fostering trust between citizens and government institutions. Additionally, the endline impact evaluation
survey, conducted by a third party, revealed that 94 percent of respondents from access-constrained districts
reported overall satisfaction in service delivery. Notably, respondents from tribal hill districts of Karbi Anglong
and the riverine island district of Majuli reported satisfaction levels of 99 percent. Moreover, respondents from
scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities exhibited a higher proportion of satisfaction as well. (ICR,
p.11). Achieved.

Summary of Efficacy Assessment: Overall, the project's successful outcomes signify a significant
improvement in the delivery of public services in Assam, characterized by increased digitalization, enhanced
accessibility, streamlined processes, and heightened citizen satisfaction. The project exceeded its target for
PDO #1. Additionally, PDO #2 was fully achieved. In assessing the overall efficacy of the project, it is also
essential to acknowledge the initial delays in the development and integration of the ARTPS portal. These
delays were attributed to a lack of agreement within the Government of Assam regarding the approach to the
portal's development and integration with existing systems. Despite these challenges, once the ARTPS portal
became fully operational, significant progress was achieved, as evidenced by the substantial uptake in digital
interaction with RTPS services. All intermediate indicators were achieved, with the exception of meeting the
target for women applicants. While this target was not met in relative terms, the project surpassed
expectations in absolute numbers, benefiting almost 2 million women beneficiaries, demonstrating a

                            Rationale
                            Overall Efficacy is rated Substantial with significant achievements under both PDO indicators. The project
                            exceeded the end targets for PDO outcome indicators #1 and fully achieved PDO indicator 2, as well as met
                            or exceeded target values for nearly all IRIs. The evidence provided in the ICR points to the project's success
                            in enhancing public service delivery in Assam, including significant institutional strengthening contributions,
                            expansion of RTPS Act coverage to tribal areas, and important policy reforms.

                            The project catalyzed the expansion of the RTPS Act to include predominantly tribal Sixth Schedule
                            Autonomous Council areas, thereby extending the coverage of essential public services to historically
                            underserved communities. Moreover, the project facilitated crucial cross-cutting policy reforms, including
                            amendments to the Assam Right to Public Services (ARTPS) Act to specify norms for service notification and
                            delivery timelines. These reforms mandated the designation of Public Servants and Appellate Authorities for
                            grievance redressal, establishing the Assam State Commission for Right to Public Services as a high-
                            powered apex forum to enhance the effectiveness of ARTPS Act implementation, (ICR, p,13).

    5. Efficiency
   An economic analysis was conducted at Project Appraisal based on savings in transaction costs for citizens
   accessing select essential RTPS services. A citizen consultation, in six districts of Assam, reported in the PAD,
   had highlighted high intermediation and travel costs involving multiple visits to district government offices (20
   km-150 km) as associated costs for accessing necessary Government certificates. The multiple visits also
   implied time and opportunity costs from lost wages. The economic analysis estimated minimum savings to
   citizens of US$83.5 million over the five-year project period depending on the size of suggestive rents paid to
   intermediaries under four categories of services: (i) Land related services (US$80 million); (ii) Disability
   Certificates (US$3 million); (iii) Vital records certificates (US$0.5 million), and (iv) Social category certificates. A
   secondary benefit from capacity building for electronic delivery of services was seen to accrue to GoA by
   improving efficiency and productivity. The identified benefits were two-fold in nature: (1) reduction in transaction
   cost for service applicants, and (2) improvement in government ability to meet service requests in a timely
   manner. The PAD, however, did not estimate the intangible efficiency gains to GoA from improved performance

                                                                                                                               Page 8 of 16

through a combination of policy and administrative changes including new service deliver channels, connectivity,
workflow simplification, higher productivity, and less paperwork. Besides, higher access to government social
services and a more responsive administration may have contributed to a higher level of trust in public agencies.

Based on information available at the time of Project closing, a more robust and broad-based attempt has been
made to compute efficiency gains from citizen savings in transaction and opportunity cost. The estimated
efficiency gains from the 7.5 million RTPS applications processed on the portal could be as high as US$97
million in the three years of the portal’s operation.

The gains are expected to continue to accrue much beyond the project’s close. The potential savings may be
higher if other intermediation expenses are factored in addition to (i) the efficiency gains to GoA from higher
administrative and processing throughput, and (ii) efficiency gains from non-RTPS services now hosted on the
portal. The efficiency gains to Government cannot be estimated as performance of civil servants is not
quantifiable. Government productivity improvement is evident in the increase in number of services delivered
without commensurate increase in manpower. However, these have not been estimated for want of suitable
data.

Additionally, the Project has resulted in environmental and social benefits. The process re-engineering and
digitalization for many services has led to a reduction in supporting documentation for service application
thereby reducing the consumption of paper. The reduction in multiple travel to Government offices for accessing
these services has resulted in lowering the carbon footprint for these purposes. Moreover, the PFCs and CSCs
have supported local employment and promoted entrepreneurship in the state besides facilitating timely access
to a host of services that require documents provided under RTPS resulting in improved welfare for
disadvantaged beneficiaries in remote rural and indigenous communities.

of US$83.5 million to citizens over the project period, primarily from reduced transaction costs associated with
accessing essential government services. Furthermore, the estimated efficiency gains from citizen savings in
transaction and opportunity costs amounted to as much as US$97 million in just three years of the portal's
operation. Overall, the project demonstrated a high level of efficiency in achieving its objectives, delivering
tangible benefits to citizens and the government, and fostering positive environmental and social
outcomes, such as reduced paperwork and lower carbon footprint due to process re-engineering and
digitalization. It also facilitated social benefits such as local employment generation, entrepreneurship
promotion, and improved welfare for disadvantaged beneficiaries in remote rural and indigenous communities.


a. Outcome Rating
   Satisfactory


7. Risk to Development Outcome

The key outcome achieved by the project was the successful enhancement of public service delivery
efficiency in Assam through the establishment of the ARTPS Portal. The ICR notes that the GoA renamed
the ARTPS Portal to Sewa Setu and designated it as the single unified interface for delivering all government
services, both RTPS and non-RTPS, just before project closure. However, the transition to this new
portal, poses a risk to the continuity of efficient service delivery momentum achieved thus far (ICR, p. 18-
19). The shift from the existing Administrative Reforms and Training to the IT Department's new special
purpose vehicle (SPV) raises concerns about potential disruptions in institutional knowledge and capacity.

Without effective management, this change could lead to delays or inefficiencies in service provision,
undermining previous achievements. Moreover, the need for convening power and robust internal capacity
within the SPV underscores the importance of ensuring adequate resources and expertise for successful
implementation of CivicTech-oriented digital transformation. Failure to address these risks may relegate the
Sewa Setu Portal to a mere IT services provider rather than a catalyst for enhancing public service delivery
efficiency within the government's service delivery ecosystem.

This review adds the following Risk to Development Outcome: In addition to the risks associated with
institutional changes and capacity building, other potential risks to the Sewa Setu Portal include technical
challenges such as system failures, cybersecurity threats, and data privacy breaches. These risks could
compromise the reliability and security of the portal, leading to disruptions in service delivery and erosion of
public trust. Furthermore, inadequate user training and awareness programs may result in low adoption rates
and dissatisfaction among citizens. Additionally, insufficient budget allocation and resource constraints may
hinder the portal's maintenance and further development, limiting its effectiveness in the long run.
Addressing these risks requires proactive measures, including robust cybersecurity protocols,
comprehensive user education initiatives, and sustained investment in the portal's infrastructure and
operations.

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The quality of entry is deemed satisfactory. The Bank team took into account political, administrative,
  technical challenges, and global experiences in designing a project appropriate to the context. Extensive
  studies and dialogue were conducted to understand the Government's reasons for reform, IT
  infrastructure challenges, and political sensitivities. Lessons from similar projects informed the design,
  with a focus on beneficiary participation and citizen engagement. During consultations with civil society
  groups, it was observed that service delivery in the state often lacked beneficiary participation. Therefore,
  the Bank supported the development of a framework for citizen engagement and feedback related to
  service delivery in Assam as part of this project. This played a crucial role in shaping the project's
  design. Additionally, strong client engagement, facilitated by a Project Preparation Advance to the
  Government of Assam, ensured effective implementation by identifying motivated officials and
  establishing a realistic and measurable roadmap complemented by a robust monitoring and evaluation
  design.

b. Quality of supervision
 The quality of supervision is deemed satisfactory, characterized by continuity in the task team, which
 fostered trust and stability in engagement with the Project management unit (PMU), particularly amidst
 frequent changes in project leadership. The task team possessed a good nix of implementation experience
 and technical expertise. (ICR, p. 18). Implementation support missions took place every six months,
 supplemented by regular project interactions. Project ratings were adjusted by the team to reflect
 implementation progress, initially downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in November 2020 due to lack
 of progress, then restored to Moderately Satisfactory in July 2022 before upgrading to Satisfactory in
 March 2023. Open channels of communication facilitated issue identification and resolution, offering
 support as needed. As implementation advanced and key inputs were procured, the design transitioned to
 a substantially results-based approach, increasing the number of DLIs and readjusting targets, values, and
 financing share in the project from 19% to 42% to enhance outcomes. The original project closing date was
 timely extended to ensure implementation continuity and achieve satisfactory project closure. Despite
 COVID-19 travel restrictions, the Bank and PMU maintained virtual collaboration, coinciding with a surge in
 demand for digitalized services during the pandemic.

     Assam Citizen-Centric Service Delivery (P150308)




a. M&E Design
 The Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system was comprehensive, utilizing various instruments and
 data sources including baseline and endline surveys, quarterly and annual reports, data on citizen usage of
 the ARTPS Portal, administrative data from departments, remote monitoring of PFCs, and beneficiary
 feedback collected online and through the RTPS Call Centre. An elaborate ARTPS Management
 Information System (MIS) with a dashboard was developed to monitor progress, interfaced with the Appeal
 Management System and grievance redressal mechanisms. The M&E design also involved outbound calls
 from the Call Centre to gather beneficiary feedback on service access and satisfaction, facilitating real-time
 performance assessment and identification of areas needing attention to support project implementation
 effectively, (ICR, p. 15).



b. M&E Implementation
  Once the ARTPS Portal became fully operational in October 2021, it facilitated the generation of real-time
  data on service delivery quality and compliance with statutory timelines, resolution of appeals, beneficiary
  feedback, and effectiveness of grievance redress mechanisms. The centralized ARTPS MIS repository
  consolidated this information for analytical insights and objective performance measurement. Baseline
  and endline surveys provided a comprehensive understanding of service access and quality, while an
  independent verification agency verified DLI achievements, enhancing the project's Monitoring and
  Evaluation (M&E) framework.



c. M&E Utilization
  Quarterly and annual reports detailing progress against agreed results were prepared using the M&E
  system.

  However, due to insufficient progress in the early project years, these reports served limited purpose
  until the end of FY2021.

  With the commissioning of the ARTPS portal, the relevance of periodic M&E reports increased,
  contributing to tracking project results. The RTPS Performance Management Unit utilized M&E products
  to enhance ARTPS implementation quality. The Chief Minister's Dashboard facilitated data-driven policy
  formulation by closely tracking RTPS implementation effectiveness through API-based data exchange
  with RTPS MIS. Additionally, the M&E system provided geographic and socio-economic details of
  project interventions and micro-innovations, while the endline impact evaluation report offered
  evidentiary insights used in the GoA's Service Delivery Report at project closure.

    Assam Citizen-Centric Service Delivery (P150308)



a. Safeguards
  Environment Safeguards: Although the Project was rated ‘substantial’ in terms of overall safeguard risk,
  the environmental risk has consistently been low, as the activities posed no risk to the environment, with
  only OP BP 4.01 Safeguard Policy - Environmental Assessment, being triggered. Activities primarily
  involved minor refurbishment and establishment of PFCs in existing structures, posing no significant
  environmental threat. Environmental screening of all planned sites was completed successfully, and
  capacity was built for environmental management. Solar rooftop feasibility assessments were conducted for
  rural sites with intermittent power supply, leading to installations in 15 PFCs. The project adhered to waste
  treatment guidelines, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Overall, the project had no direct
  environmental impact, maintaining a satisfactory safeguards rating throughout its duration.

  Social safeguards: Social safeguard compliance was a priority for the project, particularly in tribal-
  dominated Sixth Schedule areas like Bodoland Territorial Council, North Cachar Hills, and Karbi Anglong.
  Meaningful consultations with tribal leaders informed the Tribal Development Plan (TDP), which
  emphasized social and cultural interventions. Workshops were conducted to disseminate the TDP and
  action plans to local citizens, SHGs, and frontline government functionaries. The TDP summary was
  translated and disseminated in local languages, fostering community engagement. All three ACs adopted
  the ARTPS, becoming legally accountable for service delivery within stipulated timelines. They notified 119
  citizen-centric services under the RTPS and established PFCs with disabled-friendly access and essential
  amenities. The project engaged with tribal apex organizations, resulting in RTPS notification of Scheduled
  Tribe certificates. Over 400,000 online services were delivered to tribal people by June 2023, with initiatives
  like developing an abridged version of ARTPS in braille for visually impaired citizens. The grievance redress
  system was fully operational, with training provided to public grievance officers from 24 service delivery
  departments. Mission Sadbhavna utilized the GRM system to resolve pending grievances in a time-bound
  manner. The toll-free call center facilitated grievance lodging and received and addressed over 400 queries,
  while also collecting citizens' telephonic feedback on service access. These efforts contributed to more
  responsive and accountable governance and service delivery in tribal areas.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
  The project's financial management arrangements, based on the use of country systems, were deemed
  adequate for ensuring fiduciary assurance. Double-entry cash-based accounting was utilized for the TA
  component, while the Treasury system was employed for the underlying Eligible Expenditure Program
  (EEP) for the DLIs. The PMU maintained proper records and submitted quarterly reports, disbursement
  claims, and audit reports to the Bank on time. With no major audit findings, the project's financial
  management performance was satisfactory, supported by simplified arrangements and qualified staff.

  However, finalizing the procurement strategy for major procurements, including PFC service providers and
  ARTPS portal development, faced delays, mainly due to challenges in selecting providers fluent in the local
  language. The procurement of computers for departments was also delayed due to the COVID-19
  pandemic. Nonetheless, once contracts were awarded, project momentum and disbursement improved.
  The project adhered to procurement guidelines, with the New Procurement Framework not applicable.

c. Unintended impacts (Positive or Negative)
   The project had unintended outcomes and impacts, notably reinforcing trust between citizens and the state
   by facilitating efficient and accountable service delivery. Following the inauguration of the ARTPS Portal in
   October 2021, there was a remarkable increase in service applications, accompanied by high levels of
   citizen satisfaction.

   Additionally, the project drove service delivery innovation, including automated instant delivery of select
   services and composite delivery of service packages, leading to up to 50% reduction in service delivery
   timelines. The surge in service requests surpassed expectations, with approximately 1.5 million RTPS
   services applied through various channels. Interestingly, the endline impact evaluation revealed that many
   of these service applications were handled by informal facilitators or submitted in private establishments,
   with applicants incurring modest expenses. This unanticipated trend could be formalized as a rural
   entrepreneurship initiative for delivering last-mile services to citizens, mitigating risks associated with
   informality and intermediary dependence, (ICR, p. 14).

The ICR identifies several lessons, with which this review adopts. The key lessons are extracted
below:

    1. Comprehensive Citizen-Centric Approach: The Project demonstrated the effectiveness of
         engaging communities and leveraging technology to enhance service delivery. By involving
         stakeholders through targeted efforts and community consultations, the project aligned
         government services with traditional community systems, fostering mutual trust between
         citizens and the state. Additionally, the implementation of multi-channel service delivery,
         including human-assisted and direct digital channels, facilitated ease of access for citizens.

       Policy reforms and institutional arrangements further strengthened accountability and
       responsiveness in service delivery.
    2. Integration of Technology and Human Interaction: While technology played a pivotal role
       in streamlining processes and expanding access to services, the project recognized the
       continued importance of human interaction, especially through physical access points like
       PFCs. These centers provided essential support for individuals requiring in-person
       assistance, complementing digital service delivery efforts. Moreover, the involvement of
       trusted intermediaries, similar to the 'Tax Return Preparer' model, offered opportunities for
       rural entrepreneurship and improved service accessibility, particularly in remote areas.
    3. Streamlining Procurement Processes: The project's experience highlighted the
       importance of finalizing procurement strategies early on, particularly for major procurements.
       Delays in procurement strategy formulation, especially for PFC service providers and IT
       services, led to project delays. However, once these contracts were awarded, momentum
       increased, reflecting the critical role of streamlined procurement processes in project
       implementation. This underscores the need for proactive planning and efficient execution of
       procurement activities to ensure timely project delivery.

In summary, the Project provides valuable lessons for replicable models in other regions facing
similar challenges. These lessons underscore the significance of community engagement,
technological innovation, policy reform, and streamlined procurement processes in achieving
efficient, accountable, and citizen-responsive governance.

This review adds the following:

        Proactive stakeholder engagement for timely project implementation: The project's
         initial delays in developing and integrating the ARTPS portal highlight the critical need for
         proactive stakeholder engagement. Early involvement of the Government of Assam and key
         stakeholders could have facilitated consensus-building on the portal's development approach
         and integration with existing systems. Comprehensive feasibility studies and risk
         assessments should be conducted early to anticipate and mitigate potential challenges.
        Ensuring inclusive service delivery through Indigenous community engagement: The
         project's success in tribal-dominated areas underscores the importance of engaging tribal
         communities in the service delivery process. Meaningful consultations with tribal leaders and
         traditional village councils facilitated the development of tailored interventions aligned with
         community needs and cultural sensitivities. The translation and dissemination of service
         information in local languages enhanced accessibility and participation among tribal
         populations. Moreover, initiatives such as the Tribal Development Plan (TDP) addressed
         specific challenges faced by tribal communities, fostering trust and accountability in
         governance. This highlights the necessity of adopting culturally sensitive approaches and
         actively involving marginalized communities to ensure equitable and inclusive service
         delivery outcomes.
