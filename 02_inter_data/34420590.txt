2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The Program Development Objective (PDO) for the Vanuatu Disaster Risk Management Development Policy
Grant with a Catastrophe-Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO), as stated in the Program Document (PD) is
to "enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to (i) manage and reduce the risks
associated with natural disasters and climate change, and (ii) improve the management of public debt".


                                                                                                   Page 1 of 14

There was no formal PDO stated in the Financing Agreement. The two sub-objectives of the PDO correspond
to the Pillars of the operation.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The program supports the development and implementation of policies and reforms under two key pillars,
corresponding to the sub-objectives of the PDO:

    1. Pillar A: Managing and Reducing Disaster and Climate Risk (2 Prior Actions)
    2. Pillar B: Managing Public Debt (1 Prior Action)


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The Vanuatu Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Grant with a Cat DDO was financed through an
International Development Association (IDA) grant. The approved amount for this operation was SDR 7.3 million,
equivalent to US$10 million. The operation was approved on January 7, 2020 and closed on its original closing
date, June 30, 2023.

The operation was designed as a single-tranche disbursement, aligned with standard DPF practices. In response
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Vanuatu requested a change to the trigger definition to include
public health emergencies and the operation was restructured to adjust the trigger criteria. Following this change,
the full disbursement of the Cat DDO was requested and approved in April 2020, providing crucial liquidity for the
country’s response to the pandemic and subsequent recovery efforts. The actual amount disbursed was
US$9,925,810, with a minor discrepancy due to exchange rate fluctuations.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Country context

 The objectives of the Cat DDO were directly aligned with Vanuatu’s critical development challenges. Vanuatu,
 a small island developing state, faces significant vulnerabilities to natural disasters, including tropical cyclones,
 volcanic eruptions, and rising sea levels due to climate change. The country's limited economic base,
 combined with its geographic isolation, exacerbate these vulnerabilities. The PDOs focused on enhancing
 disaster risk management (DRM) and public debt management, addressing these core vulnerabilities.
 Strengthening institutional capacity to manage and reduce disaster risks was a necessary response to the
 country’s frequent exposure to natural disasters, as highlighted in the SCD. The emphasis on improving public
 debt management was equally pertinent, given Vanuatu’s moderate risk of debt distress, as identified by the
 Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA).

 Government strategies

 The objectives were also aligned with Vanuatu’s national development priorities as outlined in the National
 Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2016-2030 and the Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 14

Reduction (CCADRR) Policy 2016-2030. These strategies emphasized the need to institutionalize climate
change adaptation and disaster risk reduction across all levels of government and integrate these concerns
into broader development planning. By focusing on DRM and public debt management, the PDOs directly
supported these national priorities, particularly in strengthening the regulatory and institutional frameworks
necessary for building resilience to natural disasters. The alignment of the PDOs with these strategies ensured
that the operation was addressing the most pressing challenges facing the country, thus making it a highly
strategic use of World Bank resources.

World Bank Strategies

The PDOs were consistent with the World Bank’s Regional Partnership Framework (RPF) for nine Pacific
Island Countries (PICs) for FY17–FY23, which included Vanuatu. The RPF identified climate change and
disaster resilience, along with prudent fiscal management, as critical areas of focus. The Cat DDO operation’s
objectives directly contributed to these goals by supporting policy reforms in DRM and public debt
management. Furthermore, the operation aligned with the World Bank’s broader commitment to global
frameworks such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate
Change, which emphasize the importance of building resilience and adapting to climate change.

The Bank’s support was crucial in leveraging global expertise and providing the financial instruments
necessary for immediate response and long-term resilience building. The objectives were appropriately set at
a level that matched the depth and scope of the reforms supported. The focus on specific, achievable goals—
such as the development and implementation of a national DRM framework and the enhancement of debt
management practices—ensured that the operation could make a meaningful contribution to Vanuatu’s
resilience and fiscal stability.

The relevance of objectives was rated High.


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

Objective 1: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to manage and
reduce the risks associated with natural disasters and climate change.

Pillar A: Managing and Reducing Disaster and Climate Risk: This pillar focuses on enhancing the
regulatory framework and institutional capacities for resilience at both national and local levels. It aims to
provide a comprehensive approach to risk reduction and climate adaptation across the country.

Prior Action (PA) 1: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has approved, and submitted to the
Parliament, a Bill for the Disaster Risk Management Act, which provides for an integrated approach to
disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, disaster preparedness, response, and recovery
at national and local levels.

This PA is directly relevant to achieving the PDO of enhancing the regulatory framework and institutional
capacity to manage and reduce disaster and climate risks. By establishing a comprehensive DRM Act, the PA
addressed the critical need for an integrated and systematic approach to disaster risk management, which was
previously fragmented and reactive. The DRM Act ensures that disaster risk management is embedded across

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 14

various layers of governance, supporting a whole-of-society approach to resilience. For example, the act
formalizes the establishment of Provincial and Municipal Disaster and Climate Change Committees (PDCCCs
and MDCCCs). These committees are tasked with coordinating and implementing disaster risk reduction and
climate adaptation activities at the community level, bridging the gap between national policies and local action.
The PA is based on sound analytical underpinnings, including the following: GoV (2017). Review of National
Disaster Act 2000; GoV (2016). National Sustainable Development Plan (2016-2030); GoV (2016). Vanuatu
Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction Policy 2016-2030; UNISDR (2015). Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; and World Bank (2015). Guide to Developing Disaster
Recovery Frameworks. The relevance of PA1 was rated Satisfactory.

PA2: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has approved a National Land Subdivision Policy, which
provides for risk-informed land and settlement development, with minimum standards for disaster risk
reduction.

This PA is critical for managing and reducing disaster and climate risks by ensuring that land development in
Vanuatu is guided by disaster risk considerations. The National Land Subdivision Policy integrates disaster risk
reduction into the planning and approval processes for land use, which is crucial in a country where unplanned
and poorly regulated land development has historically exacerbated vulnerability to natural hazards. The results
chain connecting this PA to the PDO is credible, as it influences how land is developed, thereby potentially
reducing exposure to risks and increasing resilience, and based on sound analytical underpinning. The PA is
supported by the following analytical underpinnings: GoV (2013). National Land Use Planning Policy; Advisory
Services and Analytics (ASA) on Enabling Affordable and Resilient Settlements (P157414); GoV (2015).
Tropical Cyclone Pam Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). The relevance of PA2 was rated
Satisfactory.

Objective 2: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to improve the
management of public debt.

Pillar B: Managing Public Debt: This pillar is concentrated on supporting debt management reforms as an
integral part of the Government's broader initiatives to streamline public finances. The objective is to establish
fiscal buffers that enable the Government to respond effectively to disasters and other external shocks.

PA3: The Recipient’s Council of Ministers has approved a Debt Management Strategy 2019–2022, which
contains measures to minimize the costs and risks associated with the Recipient’s public debt and sets
out plans to strengthen the Recipient’s public debt management.

This PA is highly relevant to the PDO of managing public debt effectively. The approval of a Debt Management
Strategy (DMS) was critical in ensuring that Vanuatu’s public finances remain sustainable, especially in light of
the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, such as natural disasters. The DMS approved through this PA
(2019-2022) built on and followed the DMS of 2015-2017, indicating the government's commitment to debt
management. When asked about the additionality of the operation in defining the PA, the TTL provided
additional evidence stating that TA provided by the WB to GoV during the development of the DMS helped
increased its scope, e.g., by including the requirement of concessional external debt, improving the debt
sustainability thresholds, and analyzing a large set of fiscal risks and putting forward mitigation measures for
these risks. The operation itself then provided the incentives for the government to adopt the improved DMS. As
a result, this PA contributed to fiscal stability by setting clear guidelines for debt management, including a focus
on concessional financing, and risk minimization. This PA is based on sound analytical underpinnings,

4. Relevance of Results Indicators

Rationale

Objective 1: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to manage
and reduce the risks associated with natural disasters and climate change.

       RI1: "Number of PDCCCs, MDCCCs established with funded annual work plans",
        and RI2: 'Disaster Recovery Framework developed and approved for implementation by Council
        of Ministers' were linked to PA1.
       RI3: "Subdivision Regulations integrating affordability, climate and disaster resilience adopted and
        applied", and RI4: "Disaster and climate-risk informed Land Management Planning Committee
        (LMPC) guidelines adopted and applied" were linked to PA2.

RI1 was well aligned with PA1, which involved the approval and implementation of the DRM Act. The
establishment of PDCCCs and MDCCCs was a tangible outcome that reflected the act’s emphasis on
decentralizing DRM. By measuring the number of committees with funded annual work plans, the RI
captured both the structural establishment and operational readiness of these bodies. However, while the
RI effectively tracked the formation of these committees, it was somewhat limited in its ability to fully
capture the committees' effectiveness and actual impact on disaster preparedness and response. The
mere existence of these committees, even with funded plans, does not guarantee their functionality or
influence on broader disaster risk management outcomes. Additional indicators that measure the quality
of their operations would provide a more comprehensive assessment. The relevance of RI1 was rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

RI2 aligned well with PA1 by measuring a critical output of the DRM Act—the development and formal
approval of the Disaster Recovery Framework. The RI was highly relevant as it captured a key aspect of
institutional preparedness—ensuring that a structured approach to disaster recovery is not only in place
but has been officially sanctioned at the highest levels of government. However, similar to RI1, this
indicator focused on the approval of a framework rather than its practical application or effectiveness.
While the approval is a necessary step, the ultimate success of the PA—and the achievement of the
PDO—depends on how well this framework is implemented and whether it leads to improved recovery
outcomes after disasters. The relevance of RI2 was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

RI3 was closely tied to PA2, which involved the approval of the National Land Subdivision Policy, which
mandated the development of ministerial Subdivision Regulations. By measuring both the adoption and

                                                                                                      Page 5 of 14

application of subdivision regulations, the RI was focused on practical implementation. This focus is
essential for translating policy into action. However, the indicator does not monitor the actual outcomes of
applying these regulations, leaving a gap in assessing whether they effectively enhance resilience in new
developments. As such, the relevance of RI3 was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

RI4 was closely linked to PA2. The adoption and application of the LMPC guidelines were critical for
ensuring the review and approval of subdivision applications were in accordance with the National Land
Subdivision Policy’s provisions and that disaster and climate risks were systematically integrated into land
planning and development processes. By focusing on both the adoption and application of the LMPC
guidelines, this indicator attempted to measure the practical integration of disaster and climate risk
considerations into land planning. However, like RI3, it did not monitor the outcomes of applying these
guidelines, which limited its ability to assess their effectiveness in reducing risks. The relevance of
RI4 was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Objective 2: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to improve
the management of public debt.

RI5: "Compliance with the Debt Management Strategy (DMS) condition of a minimum 35 percent grant
element for any new external financing" was linked to PA3.

RI5 is directly linked to PA3 and partly measured the effectiveness of the DMS in maintaining fiscal
sustainability by focusing on one aspect—the grant element of external financing. The indicator
was specific and measured a clear and direct outcome of the DMS. This RI not only captured the likely
impact of the PA but also served as a strong measure of progress toward achieving the relevant objective
of managing public debt. However, while the RI effectively tracked compliance with the grant element
condition, it failed to capture the broader fiscal risks associated with public debt management, such as
potential increases in overall debt levels. The relevance of RI5 was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                OBJECTIVE 1
                Objective
                Objective 1: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to manage and reduce
                the risks associated with natural disasters and climate change.

                Rationale
                Theory of change: By improving the regulatory framework and institutional capacity, the GoV can more
                effectively manage and reduce the risks associated with natural disasters and climate change. To achieve
                this, the operation has supported the enactment of the DRM Act, which establishes a coordinated approach to
                disaster risk management and climate adaptation across all levels of government. Additionally, the operation
                has facilitated the adoption of the National Land Subdivision Policy and the LMPC guidelines, which ensure
                that land use planning and development are informed by disaster and climate risks. Together, these
                incremental reforms related to improved coordination and adoption of guidelines are expected to provide the
                foundation for effective disaster risk management, reduce vulnerabilities in land development, and enhance
                resilience across Vanuatu. Overall, the PAs are clearly and casually linked to the intended program results.

                Pillar A:

                       The DRM Act was enacted.
                       Six PDCCCs and two MDCCCs were established, fulfilling the target. However, the roles of MDCCCs
                        were integrated into those of PDCCCs for better coordination.
                       The PDCCCs played a significant role in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, particularly
                        during the multiple tropical cyclones (TCs) that affected Vanuatu, including TC Harold, TC Judy, and
                        TC Kevin, illustrating the successful operationalization of these committees in fulfilling their mandate
                        and enhancing local-level disaster management capacity. The ICR also emphasized how the
                        PDCCCs has helped improve coordination and collaboration between different stakeholders at all
                        levels (p. 15).
                       The National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) was developed and approved by the Council of
                        Ministers on December 9, 2021. It was actively utilized during the recovery operations for TCs Judy
                        and Kevin.
                       The National Land Subdivision Policy was adopted. However, the development of Subdivision
                        Regulations was not completed by the target date of June 2023. In the ICR, it was stated that approval
                        was expected in July 2024 (p. 16). However, according to TTL responses provided in September
                        2024, the regulations have not yet been approved. According to the TTL responses provided for the
                        ICRR, the LMPC as the authorizing agency have been applying the Land Subdivision Policy to

       subdivision applicants, despite the Regulation remaining in draft, much thanks to the LMPC
       Guidelines covered in RI3.
      Disaster and climate-risk informed LMPC Guidelines were developed and formally adopted in Match
       20, 2024, after being delayed for the same reason as the Land Subdivision Regulations. However,
       even before being formally adopted, there was a voluntary uptake of the Guidelines both from
       subdivision applicants (land owners and developers) as well as LMPC as approving authority. As a
       result, the Guidelines have been used in the screening and review of new settlement subdivision
       applications since 2020 (49 in total) (ICR, p.17).

The Efficacy rating of Objective 1 was Moderately Satisfactory due to moderate shortcomings in achievement
of the indicators such as the delay in adopting the Subdivision Regulations.



Rating

Moderately Satisfactory

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Objective 2: Enhance the Recipient's regulatory framework and institutional capacity to improve the
management of public debt.

Rationale
Theory of change: By implementing a robust Debt Management Strategy (DMS), Vanuatu can maintain
fiscal sustainability and effectively manage its public debt, especially in the face of external shocks. This
involves adopting measures that ensure new debt is concessional and within manageable limits and that
fiscal risks are understood and mitigated. The link between the PA and intended results was clear and
credible.

      A new DMS for 2019-2022 was adopted.
      GoV fully complied with the DMS condition of maintaining a minimum 35 percent grant element for any
       new external financing. According to the ICR, this compliance was crucial for maintaining national debt
       below the designated ceiling, despite the significant challenges facing the country during program
       implementation, including the compound shock of COVID-19 and TC Harold, both in 2020 (p. 17).
      The Cat DDO was fully disbursed in April 2020 to address the immediate needs arising from the
       COVID-19 pandemic and the impacts of TC Harold, providing essential liquidity for the government's
       crisis response (ICR, p.18).

      7. Risk to Development Outcome

      The risk to sustaining the development outcomes of the Vanuatu Cat DDO operation is assessed as low
      mainly due to the strong government commitment and continued support through ongoing World Bank
      operations. The ICR presented evidence demonstrating the government's continued commitment to the
      results achieved under the program. For example, the GoV revised the National Disaster Risk Management
      (NDRM) framework in 2024 to ensure it meets operational needs (p. 16), and continued adherence to a 35
      percent grant element on new external financing under the DMS 2023-3025, which replaced the DMS
      introduced under this program (ICR, p.21). The risk to development outcomes is further mitigated by ongoing
      World Bank engagements in Vanuatu, much of which build on the successes of this program and will
      continue to support the GoV in strengthening its capacity to manage climate and disaster risk, while pursuing
      fiscal responsibility. Specifically, the Second Disaster Risk Management Development Policy Grant with a
      Cat DDO (P176930), approved in 2021, and a Resilience Development Policy Operation (DPO) with a Cat
      DDO (P181274), currently in the pipeline (ICR, p.21).

      Vanuatu CAT-DDO (P168749)



Rationale


The PDO of the operation was highly relevant to the country context. The operation design was informed
by lessons learned from previous World Bank engagements in the region and similar contexts, ensuring
that the approach was grounded in practical experience. The robust analytical underpinnings, including key
studies and TA such as ASA on land use under the Enabling Affordable and Resilient Settlements
(P157414) and the DeMPA, provided a solid foundation for the program's theory of change.

The overall program risk at approval was rated as Substantial, based on a thorough risk assessment,
identifying key challenges and appropriate mitigation measures, particularly in addressing institutional
capacity constraints. Despite this, the design may have overestimated the government’s institutional
capacity, particularly in implementing complex reforms like the Land Subdivision Regulations. The frequent
changes in leadership and the vacancy in key positions within the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources
(MoLNR) revealed the heightened political and institutional risks, partly exacerbated by back-to-back crises
facing the country between 2020-2023.

Extensive stakeholder consultations with government ministries, local communities, and development
partners further strengthened the design, ensuring alignment with national priorities and broad support for
the operation (PD, p. 29-30).

Finally, while the RIs were well-aligned with the PAs, all RIs except one were binary and focused on
upstream actions. As a result, RIs were unable to capture achievement towards the objectives (as
discussed in Section 4) and also lacked the flexibility to account for delays and challenges that arose
during implementation, such as political instability and the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g., by including
measures of intermediate progress, that would have allowed for course correction.

In summary, while the Bank’s design of the Cat DDO operation was generally strong, with well-grounded
analytical underpinnings and stakeholder consultations, there were opportunities to improve flexibility and
deepen risk mitigation strategies. The Bank's performance was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

The implementation took place during a time of unprecedented challenges, including COVID-19 crisis, back-to-
back disasters and political instability in key Ministries. Despite multiple disruptions, the Bank provided
consistent monitoring, supervision, technical assistance and capacity building activities throughout project
implementation. However, the ICR highlighted that despite proactive support, documentation of the operation's
progress was limited, with only one Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) submitted throughout the
duration of the operation (in June 2023) (p. 21). This lack of comprehensive documentation reduced the ability


                                                                                                    Page 11 of 14

to fully track and adjust the implementation strategy in response to challenges, such as delays in implementing
PA2.

In response to the identified risks of low institutional capacity, the Bank provided ongoing technical support to
key ministries and local committees. This support included conducting tsunami drills and capacity-building
activities for the newly established PDCCCs and capacity-building and strategic planning support to the Ministry
of Climate Change Adaptation (MoCCA). According to the ICR, these activities helped improve Vanuatu's
disaster preparedness. However, despite these efforts, the operation's ability to fully mitigate risks was
constrained by the intensity of the crises, which often diverted government focus from long-term resilience
reforms to immediate recovery efforts.

The Bank was proactive in identifying new and emerging risks throughout the implementation period. The team
remained engaged and responsive, with a Senior DRM Specialist based in Port Vila who maintained strong
relationships with key ministries. This ongoing engagement enabled the Bank to provide timely support, such as
handling the request to amend the Cat DDO trigger criteria to include public-health crisis, and responding to the
subsequent withdrawal request efficiently, which provided the Vanuatu government with the liquidity needed to
manage the dual shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and TC Harold. The Bank's performance during
implementation was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

Originally, the Cat DDO was designed to address natural disasters, but the conditions of the trigger of the
continent credit line was expanded to include public health emergencies after the government’s request to
amend the definition of ‘Natural Catastrophe’ in the Financing Agreement. Subsequently, after requesting a
withdrawal of the full amount of the Cat DDO it was disbursed to respond to the dual shocks of COVID-19 and
TC Harold. According to the ICR, the Cat DDO played a crucial role in the government's efforts to mitigate the

spread of COVID-19, and helped the government preserve fiscal stability while facing multiple external
shocks (p.9; p.17).



b. Environmental

The operation is expected to generate positive environmental impacts through the implementation of the DRM Act
and the Land Subdivision Policy (p. 19), but the ICR did not provide evidence on this.



c. Gender

The ICR highlights gender-related impacts, such as the inclusion of female representatives in the PDCCCs and the
emphasis on preventing sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment in the NDRF (p. 19). These gender-focused
impacts were not explicitly outlined in the PD but emerged as important aspects of the program’s implementation.

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR generally presents a candid and coherent narrative that logically flows from the program's design
through to its implementation and results. The ICR provides a reasonable evidence base to support the
achievements reported, particularly in areas like the enactment of the DRM Act and the establishment of the
PDCCCs. However, the ICR could have strengthened the analysis of the additionality of the operation,
particularly in relation to the DMS, which was an established government instrument before the Bank's
engagement. Overall, the ICR is concise and focused, avoiding unnecessary detail and concentrating on critical
information and evidence. As such the quality of the ICRR was rated Substantial.

12. Lessons

Some of the key lessons adapted from the ICR are as follows:

The inclusion of health-related events in the definition of eligible catastrophes that trigger the Cat
DDO enhances its flexibility and responsiveness. By adopting an integrated approach to risk management
that includes health risk, the instrument ensures timely disbursements in response to a wider range of
emergencies, enabling more comprehensive and effective responses.

Adapting to unprecedented crises requires more comprehensive risk mitigation strategies. While the
operation was designed to account for potential crises, the compounded effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and
multiple natural disasters exceeded expectations, creating significant operational challenges. This experience
highlights the need for greater flexibility in project design and delivery, including enhanced remote execution
capabilities and adaptive technical assistance. The lesson emphasizes that anticipating crises is not enough—
operations must also prepare for the unpredictability and intensity of crises to ensure the resilience and
continuity of reform efforts.

A Cat DDO is most effectively realized within a portfolio of operations and technical assistance. By
complementing the Cat DDO with ongoing World Bank-financed projects and over a decade of technical support
in disaster risk management, the reforms gained momentum and were more effectively implemented. The
sustained engagement through technical assistance and complementary projects helped mitigate risks, ensuring
that the Cat -DDO's objectives were not only met but could be sustained over time.
