a. Objectives

The wording of the program development objective of the First, Second, and Third Republic of Sierra Leone
Productivity and Transparency Support Development Policy Operation (DPO) changed from the first operation -
“to contribute to the Government of Sierra Leone’s objective of achieving sustainable and inclusive economic
development through: (a) increasing productivity in selected economic sectors and (ii) improving transparency
and accountability in selected government decision making processes” to the second and third operations - “to
achieve sustainable and inclusive economic development by: (a) creating the conditions for increased productivity
in selected economic sectors and (ii) improving transparency in selected government decision-making
processes.”

This ICR Review parses the program development objective into two sub-objectives:

1. To create the conditions for increased productivity in selected economic sectors,
2. To improve transparency in selected government decision-making processes.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The programmatic series had two policy areas:

Creating Conditions for Increased Productivity in Selected Economic Sectors comprised policy,
legislative, regulatory, and institutional reforms in agriculture and fisheries, including land tenure,
marine resources, energy, and education. This policy area supported measures to: (a) expand the role of the
private sector in the production and distribution of improved seeds; (b) expand the role of the private sector in
the production and distribution of fertilizers; (c) improve the value chain in rice cultivation; (d) strengthen the land
tenure regime; (e) revert marine fishing to sustainable levels; (f) reduce technical losses in electricity
transmission and distribution; and (g) improve the quality of teaching for better student learning outcomes.

Improving Transparency in Selected Government Decision-Making Processes comprised legislative,
regulatory, and operational reforms in the fiscal regime and public financial management, government
procurement, and anti-corruption. This policy area supported measures to (a) establish a Single Treasury
Account for government revenue collections; (b) rationalize and standardize the tax and contract regime for
mining activity; (c) strengthen the land tenure system and improve the land management system for greater land
tenure security; (d) introduce e-procurement for efficiency; and (e) improve the transparency of asset disclosures
by government officials.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

Program Cost and Financing. The first operation was estimated to cost Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 22
million (US$30 million equivalent) and was financed by an IDA credit of SDR 16.1 million (US$22 million
equivalent) and a grant of SDR 5.9 million (US$8 million equivalent), of which the amount of SDR 22 million
(US$41.1 million equivalent) was fully disbursed. The second operation was estimated to cost SDR 28.6 million
(US$40 million equivalent) and was financed by an IDA grant of SDR 28.6 million (US$40 million equivalent), of
which the amount of SDR 28.6 million (US$39.7 million equivalent) was fully disbursed. The third operation was
estimated to cost SDR 73.2 million (US$100 million equivalent) and was financed by an IDA grant of SDR 73.2
million (US$100 million equivalent), of which the amount of SDR 73.2 million (US$101.6 million equivalent) was

fully disbursed.


Dates. The Bank approved the first operation on June 30, 2017. It became effective on July 20, 2017 and
closed as scheduled on December 31, 2018. The Bank approved the second operation on March 19, 2019. It
became effective on March 27, 2019 and closed as scheduled on October 31, 2019. The Bank approved the
third operation on June 17, 2020. It became effective on July 3, 2020 and closed as scheduled on December
31, 2020.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Binding Constraints. The program development objectives were relevant to the development challenges
 facing Sierra Leone identified in the Republic of Sierra Leone Systematic Country Diagnostic - Priorities for
 Sustainable Growth and Poverty Reduction (SCD) of 2018. According to the SCD:

       Productivity in agriculture, the country’s primary livelihood source, was “constrained by failures in
          input markets.” Specifically, yields were below the productive frontier because of the low uptake of
          modern seeds, chemical and organic fertilizers, and mechanization. Additionally, the traditional land
          tenure system was unequal, with women, youth, and migrants from outside the community less able
          to access land, reducing tenure security and impeding long-term investment. “Output markets were
          not sufficient to promote sales and rural incomes.” In particular, poor storage, a lack of rural roads
          linking rural areas to the capital, Freetown, and other urban centers, and inadequate processing
          facilities constrained rice sales.
         The “infrastructure deficit in energy,” as well as in transportation and information and communication
          technology, “impeded private sector investment by increasing costs and preventing links between
          internal and external markets.” Moreover, access to electricity benefitted only about 10 percent of the
          total population, of which 95 percent lived in Freetown.
         Improving human capital would require a dramatic increase in the quality of public services. Access
          was not the only issue in education, but the “quality and relevance of instruction was lacking” as well,
          as reflected in students’ low levels of achievement on international tests.
         Mobilizing more domestic revenues would be the long-term solution to creating fiscal space. Apart
          from reducing the generous level of tax exemptions, tapping into revenues from mining would be
          opportune in the near to medium term. However, it was unlikely this would happen “unless the country
          improved the governance of the mining sector, including by adopting and enforcing credible legal,
          administrative, and institutional frameworks through amendments to the mining code”
         Public spending was inefficient, dragged down by “bottlenecks in public financial management and
          procurement.” In public financial management, there would need to be considerable institutional
          change and capacity development across central government ministries, departments, and
          agencies. On procurement, a government decision to implement e-procurement could focus on
          sustained incremental efforts at reform.
         Sierra Leone had “made some inroads” in building the foundations for an effective public
          administration, but these efforts were “frequently met with resistance.” As a result, the country still
          ranked far below the regional average on indicators of government effectiveness, the rule of law, and


                                                                                                      Page 4 of 32

        control of corruption. The country had modernized the legislative frameworks for procurement and
        anti-corruption, but implementation lagged far behind.

Bank Group Strategy. The program development objectives reflected the priorities of the World Bank Group
in Sierra Leone. The last Country Assistance Strategy covered FY2010-FY2013, before the appraisal of the
first operation, and the first Country Partnership Framework covered FY2021-FY2026, after the closing of the
third operation). The Sierra Leone Completion and Learning Review (CLR) Review of May 2020 imputed the
country strategy in FY2014-FY2019 from the profile of the Bank Group’s operations in the country over the
period. The CLR Review distilled the strategy as consisting of ten objectives focused on human
development, promoting inclusive growth, and managing the extractive boom.

       Reforms under the first policy pillar of this programmatic series supported the objectives to: “improve
        the efficiency and transparency of agriculture and fisheries;” “improve access to sustainable electricity
        infrastructure services;” and “improve the capacity to effectively and efficiently deliver education.”
       Reforms under the second policy pillar supported the objectives to: “improve predictability,
        expenditure control, and transparency in decentralization and public resource management” and
        “strengthen the capacity to manage the boom in the extractive sector.”

Objective 1 - Create the Conditions for Increased Productivity in Selected Economic Sectors

Seeds



                                                                                                    Page 10 of 32

     Productivity and Transparency Support Cr (P156651)



      PA1, PA2, and PA3 comprised a sequence of legal, regulatory, and institutional measures to promote
       foundation seed production, multiplication, and distribution by the private sector. Use of improved
       high-yielding seeds was low across all farm sectors: (a) 73 percent of farmers typically used seeds
       recycled from previous harvests; (b) only about 10 percent had access to improved seeds; and (c)
       while seed production and distribution had been liberalized, the roles of the public and private sectors
       had not been delineated, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry continuing to compete with the
       private enterprises in the production and distribution of seeds. The three PAs would strengthen the
       regulatory framework to make modern seeds available to farmers by increasing private sector
       participation. Previous analytical work had found the lack of private sector participation the binding
       constraint holding back uptake of modern seeds, fertilizer, and rice technology (see section 8a). Thus,
       increasing private sector participation would create conditions for increased productivity.
      PA1 required the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to submit the Sierra Leone Seed Certification
       Act of 2017 to Parliament for approval. The legislation would promote the private sector’s production,
       multiplication, and distribution of certified seeds. Therefore, the relevance of PA1 is rated
       satisfactory.
      PA2 required Parliament to enact the Seed Certification Agency Act. As the government would
       relinquish its role in seed production and delivery, the Seed Certification Agency would be critical to
       ensuring the quality of certified seeds by harnessing the expertise of seed laboratories for quality
       control. Therefore, the relevance of PA2 is rated satisfactory.
      PA3 required the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to submit the Seed Certification Agency
       Regulations to Parliament and to establish and operationalize the Seed Certification Agency. The
       regulations would implement the Sierra Leone Seed Certification Act of 2017 and the Seed
       Certification Agency Act of 2017. Therefore, the relevance of PA3 is rated satisfactory.

Fertilizers

      PA4, PA5, and PA6 comprised a sequence of policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional measures. As
       with seeds, the use of fertilizers remained low across all farm sectors: (a) only 10 percent of farmers
       used organic fertilizers, and 4 percent used chemical fertilizers; (b) fertilizer use averaged 4 kilograms
       per hectare, compared to 10 kilograms per hectare in Sub Saharan Africa; and (c) while
       fertilizer production and distribution had been liberalized, the roles of the public and private sectors
       had not been delineated, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry continuing to compete with the
       private enterprises in the production and distribution of fertilizers. The three PAs would strengthen the
       policy and legal framework to make fertilizer more available to farmers through greater use of private
       distributors, thus addressing the binding constraint and creating conditions for increased productivity.
      PA4 required the Cabinet to approve a new fertilizer policy that would progressively reduce the direct
       government supply and distribution of fertilizer to farmers and encourage private sector supply and
       distribution instead. The policy would mandate the exit by the government from public production and
       distribution of fertilizers and promote the entry of private enterprises into these activities. Therefore,
       the relevance of PA4 is rated satisfactory.
      PA5 required Parliament to pass the National Fertilizer Regulatory Agency Act of 2017. The agency
       would regulate and supervise the manufacture, importation, and distribution of fertilizers to promote
       and develop a fertilizer industry that was competitive and sustainable. Therefore, the relevance of
       PA5 is rated satisfactory.
      PA6 required the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to submit the National Fertilizer Regulations of
       2020 to Parliament and to establish and operationalize the NaFRA. The operationalization of the
       agency would set the policy (PA4) and the legislation’s goals (PA5) into motion, with the agency’s

          would be supported by the Smallholder Commercialization and Agribusiness Development Project,
          which would also assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to set up fertilizer testing facilities. The
          relevance of PA6 is rated moderately satisfactory.

Rice

        PA7 required the Cabinet to approve and adopt the National Rice Policy of 2020 and the Rice Value
          Chain Development Strategy. Rice was essential to agricultural production (95 percent of
          farmers cultivated rice) and private consumption (annual per capita consumption of 131 kilograms
          was among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa). But productivity was low: (a) while cultivation of this
          staple food increased significantly from 0.7 million hectares in 2014 to 1.0 million hectares in 2017,
          yields improved only slightly from 1.11 to 1.36 metric tons per hectare over the same period; (b)
          production met only 60 percent of domestic demand, with imports amounting to US$191 million in
          2018; and (c) the lack of improved technologies, low levels of value chain integration, poor access to
          input and output markets, and low institutional capacity for agricultural research and development
          were significant constraints. The National Rice Policy and the Rice Value Chain Development
          Strategy aimed to increase local rice production. There was little information, however, about the
          policy and the strategy, and how they would address the binding constraints to the development of the
          rice sector other than to state, in very general terms, that policy and strategy would promote linkages
          between investors and smallholder farmers, close the shortfall in food supply, and increase rice
          production from 1.18 to 1.87 metric tons per hectare by 2021. Therefore, the relevance of PA7 is
          rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Fishing

        PA8, PA9, and PA10 comprised a set of legal, regulatory, and operational measures to return
         industrial fishing capacity to a sustainable level. However, excessive industrial fishing posed a severe
         threat to marine resources in Sierra Leone, where fish production accounted for 12 percent of GDP in
         2015: (a) the number of licensed trawlers (85 in 2016) was thrice that deemed sustainable by the
         International Seafood Sustainability Foundation’s Marine Resources Assessment Group; (b) licensed
         fish production of 22,000 metric tons per day exceeded the sustainable level of 9,000 metric tons per
         day, according to the West Africa Regional Fisheries Program; (c) the scale of the problem was likely
         far worse than the official figures depicted because of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing
         activity - aerial surveys indicated that some 30 to 50 percent of active fishing vessels were likely
         operating illegally. The three PAs would enhance the regulatory and legal framework to strengthen
         government enforcement of industrial fishing regulations. Prior analytical work (Section 8) made a
         compelling case that this would help create conditions for sustainable productivity of the fishing
         industry.
        PA8 required the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources to publish a list of all industrial vessels
         with an active license and certify that all licensed vessels were equipped with Vessel Monitoring
         System or Automatic Identification System transponders and had independent observers on board to
         strengthen the monitoring, surveillance, and control of fishing activity. The relevance of PA8 is rated
         satisfactory.
        PA9 required Parliament to enact the Fisheries and Aquaculture Act for the conservation and
         sustainable management of fisheries resources. Therefore, the relevance of PA9 is rated
         satisfactory.

   Productivity and Transparency Support Cr (P156651)



        PA10 required the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources to submit the Fisheries and
         Aquaculture Regulations to Parliament and the Cabinet to approve the National Plan of Action to
         Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing. Therefore, the relevance
         of PA10 is rated satisfactory.

Land

        PA11 and PA12 aimed to reform the land tenure system for sustainable agricultural growth and to
         create a functional land administration system that would promote land tenure security. Two separate
         legal systems governed the land – the state-owned land in Freetown and the western area but could
         sell it to private owners. At the same time, families and communities owned land elsewhere, under
         various customary laws, but under the custodianship of the chiefdom councils, and could not be
         owned privately. The prevailing land tenure system: (a) was inadequate for the small-scale
         subsistence agriculture that was prevalent in the country; (b) lacked sufficient security and safeguards
         to enable banks to extend credit to farmers using land as collateral; and (c) failed to grant equitable
         access to land for vulnerable groups, including women - many women lacked the right to inherit and
         own land although the Devolution of Estates Act of 2007 removed the customary prohibition
         against women owning property under the Customary Law.
        PA11 required the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Country Planning to adopt and submit to the
         Cabinet the Land Policy Implementation Framework and the Land Policy Implementation Plan for
         2016-2026. The policy framework and the implementation plan would implement the objectives of the
         National Land Policy adopted in 2017, which aimed to safeguard the land tenure system and rights for
         land users, streamline and modernize land transactions, encourage sustainable use of land and
         natural resources, promote responsible investment, resolve systemic conflicts between the formal
         system and informal customary systems, and provide fair mechanisms for land disputes
         resolution. Therefore, the relevance of PA11 is rated satisfactory.
        PA12 required the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Country Planning to prepare and submit to the
         Cabinet the advanced draft of the Land Commission Bill, the advanced draft of the Customary Land
         Rights Bill, and the Report on Regional Consultations, documenting the consultations conducted in
         the east, south, north and northwest regions on the proposed provisions of the two bills. The
         laws were to be consistent with the fundamental principles of the Voluntary Guidelines on the
         Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries, and Forests, the principles, and practices that
         governments can refer to (the global norm of reference) when making laws and administering land,
         fisheries, and forests rights, as endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly among other
         institutions. The first law would create the National Land Commission as a policy implementation
         body that would decentralize inclusive land administration through local offices at the chiefdom,
         district, and regional levels. The second law would recognize customary land rights, promote tenure
         security, and support land access without tribal, religious, gender, or other forms of
         discrimination. Related actions included the creation of Gender-Based Regional Land Oversight
         Committees to “integrate the voice of women” in the preparation of the new laws and the conduct of
         awareness campaigns among women about the new laws. Therefore, the relevance of PA12 is rated
         satisfactory.

Energy

        PA13, PA14, and PA15 comprised a set of institutional and operational measures to improve the
         Electric Distribution and Supply Authority’s (EDSA) performance. Electricity production and access to
         electricity in Sierra Leone were among the lowest in the world: (a) the country had only 100

                                                                                                    Page 13 of 32

    megawatts of installed generation capacity (principally from Bambuna Dam), of which 75
    megawatts was operational; (b) the demand for energy exceeded supply by about 30 percent; (c) less
    than 15 percent of the total population was connected to the electricity grid, benefitting some125,000
    households mainly in the capital, Freetown; (d) meanwhile, businesses used heavy fuel oil
    to generate high-cost electricity; (e) previous reforms included the passage of the National Electricity
    Act of 2011 (which unbundled the National Power Authority into the Electricity Generation and
    Transmission Company and the EDSA), the creation of the Electricity and Water Regulatory
    Commission in 2011, and the operationalization of the Electricity Generation and Transmission
    Company and EDSA in 2015; (e) still the energy sector suffered from under-investment and weak
    management.
   Motivated by the problem that “low access to electricity undermined productivity growth in Sierra
    Leone,” these three prior actions aimed to “support the Agenda for Prosperity’s strategic objectives to
    enhance access to reliable and cost-effective energy supply.” According to the Program Documents,
    “the focus in the short-term would be on reducing commercial losses and increasing the collection
    rate,” while “technical reduction losses require huge network investment and would take longer time to
    achieve.”
   PA13 required EDSA to adopt a strategic plan to reduce technical and commercial losses and
    improve its finances - line losses were 38 percent of electricity distributed, collections were 74 percent
    of sales, and the cash flow deficit was 27 percent of total revenue. Considering the institutional
    weaknesses in the energy agencies, “adopting” a plan would not be sufficient to secure the
    subsequent implementation of the plan. Two actions could have strengthened the link between
    planning and implementation along the results chain: (a) a performance contract between EDSA and
    the government, and (b) an explicit external technical assistance program supporting the
    implementation of the plan. Therefore, the relevance of PA13 is rated moderately satisfactory.
   PA14 required EDSA to adopt and implement the Network Configuration Optimization Plan (NCOP)
    that would reduce technical losses by signing a contract with Network Energy Services
    Corporation. The NCOP was developed to determine the optimal changes to the distribution network,
    balance power evacuation between the 33-kilovolt and the 11-kilovolt networks and reduce system
    losses through the new configuration. Implementation of the NCOP would complement investments
    in the transmission and distribution infrastructure funded by the Energy Sector Utility Reform Project
    (P120304) and the overhead transmission lines connecting Sierra Leone, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and
    Guinea funded by the West African Power Pool Project (P163033). Therefore, this prior action was
    aligned with the thrust of PA13, and its relevance is rated satisfactory.
   PA15 required EDSA to approve a new organizational structure and appoint the senior managers for
    distribution and technical services, quality assurance and compliance, accounts and financial
    management, the chief financial officer, and the commercial services director. The staff appointments
    were necessary to strengthen the institutional and organizational capacity of the utility firm. The prior
    action offered little assurance that the appointments would bring in capable
    management. Accordingly, the relevance of PA15 is rated moderately satisfactory.
   The fourth prior action in this sector exceeded the productivity objective and the immediate focus on
    reducing commercial and technical losses. The second Program Document does not argue a direct
    productivity objective and only acknowledges that “this action will complement the implementation of
    EDSA’s NCOP to reduce technical losses on the transmission and distribution network.” Rather, the
    appraisal document explains, “Although the liberalization of fuel prices will make ETGC plants more
    expensive to run, it is expected to reduce inefficiency in setting electricity tariffs culminating in the
    reduction of EDSA’s commercial losses and the Government’s indirect subsidy to the energy
    sector. Furthermore, the fuel subsidy is not well targeted as it benefits mostly the well-off segment of


                                                                                                Page 14 of 32

      society and crowds out spending on social sectors including health and education.” However, fiscal
      efficiency is not an objective of this programmatic series, at least not the objectives that were
      approved by the Board at the appraisal of each operation.
     PA16 required the government to eliminate subsidies on petroleum products and adopt an automatic
      fuel price indexation formula to determine fuel prices based on international fuel prices and prevailing
      exchange rates. Surpassing the focus of PA13, PA14, and PA15 on operational improvements at
      EDSA, this prior action aimed to rationalize fuel pricing by scrapping energy subsidies and allowing
      the pass-through of international to domestic fuel prices. Although the relevance of this prior action
      would be rated highly satisfactory if the objective were to improve fiscal efficiency (i.e., by reducing
      energy subsidies), this prior action was not directly related to the productivity objective. Therefore, the
      relevance of PA16 is rated moderately satisfactory.

Education

     PA17, PA18, and PA19 comprised a set of measures to implement provisions of the Teaching Service
      Commission Act of 2011. Education outcomes remained poor in Sierra Leone despite recent
      improvements in access to education. The poor quality of teaching was a significant factor: (a) the
      primary grade completion rate was 66 percent in 2015, lower than the average 69 percent in Sub-
      Saharan Africa; (b) learning outcomes were subpar beginning in second-grade elementary school
      (where 87 percent were unable to read a short text) through to senior secondary school; (c) studies
      linked poor learning outcomes to poor teaching quality; (d) only half of the teachers were qualified for
      their position, and teacher absenteeism was a high 30 percent; (e) the Teaching Service Commission
      (TSC) was created in 2011 to help upgrade the teaching profession and improve teaching and
      learning, but the TSC only appointed commissioners in 2016 and has not implemented many
      provisions of the Teaching Service Commission Act of 2011.
     PA17 required the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology to issue a transition plan setting
      the schedule for transferring functionaries, files, and records to the TSC. In addition, the Teaching
      Service Commission Act of 2011 mandated the transfer of functions and responsibilities over teacher
      registration and licensing, teacher management (recruitment, transfer, dismissal, promotion, and
      retirement), teacher records and payroll, teacher professional development and performance, and
      teacher-employer relations from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the Ministry
      of Basic and Secondary Education to the TSC. The prior action does not provide any explanation
      how transferring functionaries, files, and records would improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, the
      relevance of PA17 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
     PA18 required the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education to transfer all duties and
      responsibilities of teacher management to the TSC. This prior action would implement the transition
      plan designed under PA17. It would also enable the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education to
      focus on oversight over school curriculum, standards for approving new schools, guidance and
      counseling services for students, and research and development, as provided in the Education Act of
      2004. But, like PA17, this prior action does not provide any explanation how transferring duties and
      responsibilities over teacher management would improve the quality of teaching. Therefore, the
      relevance of PA18 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
     PA19 required the TSC to approve and adopt a teacher deployment strategy and protocol and to pilot
      a teacher attendance monitoring system. This prior action aimed to rationalize the deployment of
      teachers across the country (some regions had more teachers than needed, others less). Meanwhile,
      the attendance monitoring system would help the effort to reduce teacher absenteeism, a nagging
      problem and a key target both of the Teaching Service Commission Act of 2011 and this
      programmatic series. However, more regular attendance of poorly qualified teachers does not really

                                                                                                    Page 15 of 32

         address the fundamental problem of poor qualification of teachers and hence poor quality of
         teaching. Therefore, the relevance of PA19 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Objective 2 - Improve Transparency in Selected Government Decision-Making Processes

Fiscal

      PA20 and PA21 comprised legal measures to improve government revenue management and the
       fiscal regime for mining activities, removing binding constraints to transparency and thus contributing
       to Objective 2.
      PA20 required the Ministry of Finance to direct all government ministries, departments, and agencies
       to transfer revenues into a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The legal framework was already in
       place, but many government bodies did not follow the law. Instead, they held as much as ten percent
       of the budget in multiple accounts at commercial banks and outside standard reporting requirements,
       according to the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Report of 2017. Thus, it was
       doubtful that another Ministry of Finance order directing transfers of revenue collections to a TSA
       would have sufficed. A more powerful prior action would have been the outright prohibition against
       ministries, departments, and agencies holding accounts at commercial banks. The rationale would be
       more efficient cash management by the whole government, further enabling a reduction of short-term
       debt that is usually contracted to smooth cash flows. Therefore, the relevance of PA20 is rated
       unsatisfactory.
      PA21 required Parliament to enact the Extractive Industries Revenue Act (EIRA). The fiscal regime
       had been arbitrary, opaque, and often required case-by-case negotiation between the government
       and license holders. The EIRA would promote a transparent, stable, predictable, and robust fiscal
       regime for future mining contracts. Therefore, the relevance of PA21 is rated satisfactory.

Procurement

      PA22 and PA23 aimed to strengthen the law and improve public procurement by emphasizing e-
       procurement. However, procurement continued to be challenging: (a) the passage of the Public
       Procurement Act of 2004, which also created the National Public Procurement Authority (NPPA),
       harmonized public procurement practices across the public sector; (b) however, compliance with
       procurement policy had been poor, with the share of public procurement conducted through open
       competition at only 45 percent in the baseline; (c) the country’s score of “C” continued on public
       procurement transparency, competition, and complaints mechanisms in the Public Expenditure and
       Financial Accountability assessment was unchanged from 2007; (d) yet the public sector needed to
       urgently improve public procurement as the quality of procured goods and services remained poor
       while the government was ramping up investment spending.
      PA22 required the Cabinet to approve the development of an electronic procurement (e-procurement)
       system to improve transparency in procurement. E-procurement is buying and selling goods and
       services over the internet using digital communication lines between a buyer and its suppliers
       that support requisitioning, ordering, and exchanging documents. Apart from saving on the costs
       associated with paper-based systems, e-procurement would improve the collection, tracking,
       organization, analysis, and evaluation of procurement transaction data and hence increase the
       transparency and accountability of the procurement process. This prior action assumes that there is
       capacity to establish, implement, and manage the e-procurement system. The relevance of PA22 is
       rated moderately satisfactory.


                                                                                                 Page 16 of 32

     Productivity and Transparency Support Cr (P156651)



       PA23 required the NPPA to submit to Parliament and Parliament to enact the Public Procurement
         Regulations that would implement the Public Procurement Act of 2016 and, among others, roll out the
         e-procurement system nationwide. The Public Procurement Act of 2016 aimed to regulate the
         procurement process further, decentralize procurement, and “ensure value for money” in public
         procurement and spending. As with PA23, the focus of PA24 on e-procurement would lead to better
         organization and tracking of procurement transactions, allow for the integration of supply chains, and
         facilitate the faster delivery of procured goods and services. And, as with PA23, the crucial question
         is whether or not the government has the capacity to establish the infrastructure and implement the
         system. Therefore, the relevance of PA23 is rated moderately satisfactory.

 Anti-Corruption

       PA24, PA25, and PA26 comprised a sequence of legal and regulatory measures to boost the anti-
        corruption drive by focusing on transparency requirements for government officials. Corruption
        remained a significant issue in Sierra Leone despite recent gains: (a) the number of cases prosecuted
        rose, and monetary recoveries topped Sierra Leonean leone (Le) 10 billion between 2008 and 2012,
        following the creation of the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in 2000; (b) however, the country
        continued to score low on many metrics, including ranking 123rd of 167 countries in Transparency
        International’s Corruption Perceptions Index in 2016 (at the time of appraisal of the first operation); (c)
        an effective asset disclosure system for public officials was critical to reduce corruption, foster
        accountability, enhance legitimacy, promote integrity, and protect public assets; (d) the Anti-
        Corruption Act of 2008 required the filing of asset, liability, and income disclosure statements by
        public and civil servants when they assume and when they leave office; but (e) the rule was poorly
        implemented – the fact that the rule applied to all public servants made it difficult to enforce.
       PA24 required the ACC to call on government officers who had not filed their statements of assets,
        liabilities, and income statements to do so by October 2016. Compliance by some 55,000 public
        servants had been deficient at 20 percent in 2016, with sanctions - fines and prison terms - barely
        implemented. This prior action would likely achieve a one-time bump in filings, which, absent effective
        sanctions, would not likely be sustained. The relevance of PA24 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
       PA25 required the ACC to submit to Parliament an Asset Disclosure Regulation redefining which
        public servants were covered by the disclosure requirements and imposing administrative sanctions
        for non-compliance with the disclosure requirements. This prior action addressed the sanctions
        issue but fell short of requiring Parliament to approve the regulation. Accordingly, the relevance of
        PA25 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.
       PA26 required Parliament to enact amendments to the Anti-Corruption Act of 2008. The new Anti-
        Corruption Act of 2019 would: (a) employ a risk-based approach to focus the disclosure
        rule on political appointees, officers with fiduciary responsibilities, and their relatives; (b) expand
        sanctions to include the withholding of salaries, suspension from service after three months, and
        removal from service after six months; (c) include redress for officers who submit false, misleading, or
        inaccurate information; (d) replace the requirement that Commissioners of Oath attest the
        declarations with a penal affirmation instead, delivered personally or electronically; and (e) digitize the
        asset declaration process. Accordingly, the relevance of PA26 is rated satisfactory.

       Productivity and Transparency Support Cr (P156651)



Seeds

        RI1 - Number of private licensed firms in the seed sector - could measure the impact of prior actions to
          boost private sector activity in seed production and distribution of improved seed. However, the
          existence of licenses does not itself imply active participation in the market. More importantly, outcome-
          oriented indicators, such as private-sector seed sales or market share, would have been
          preferable. Therefore, the relevance of RI1 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Fertilizers

        RI2 - Number of private licensed firms in the fertilizer sector - could measure the impact of prior actions
          to boost private sector activity in fertilizer production and distribution. However, the existence of licenses
          does not itself imply active participation in the market. More importantly, outcome-oriented indicators,
          such as fertilizer sales or market share by the private sector, would have been a better
          indicator. Therefore, the relevance of RI2 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Rice

        RI3 - Average rice yield in metric tons per hectare - Even if policy change were an essential factor and its
          impact could be more narrowly identified, it would likely take time to achieve the target as a result of the
          innovation. Therefore, linking a target in 2020 to a policy adopted months earlier would be doubly
          problematic. The relevance of RI3 is rated unsatisfactory.

Fishing

        RI4 - The number of active industrial fishing licenses - was not adequate to measure the impact of prior
          actions to reduce industrial fishing. The share of boats with transponders would have been a better
          results indicator. The relevance of RI4 is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Land

        RI5 - Share of land plots owned by women - was a worthy objective of the reform, considering that
          women-owned only 21 percent of all land plots in 2014 and there remained obstacles to women
          inheriting and owning land. The relevance of RI5 is rated satisfactory.

Energy

        RI6 - Electricity lost in percent of electricity distributed - was a poor choice to measure the impact of the
         prior actions supported by this programmatic series. PA14 aimed at reducing technical
         losses. However, the results indicator - total systems losses - is a broader measure and includes
         commercial and technical losses. According to EDSA’s load flow analysis in 2019, technical losses
         accounted for one-third and non-technical losses for two-thirds of total losses. The relevance of RI16 is
         rated moderately satisfactory.
        RI7 - Government expenditure on fuel subsidy in percent of GDP - would be fully adequate to measure
         the impact of the prior action for the government to eliminate subsidies on petroleum products and adopt
         a fuel price indexation formula based on international fuel prices and prevailing exchange rates, if the

                 objective was fiscal efficiency. However, since the objective was productivity, the relevance of RI7 is
                 rated moderately satisfactory.

  Education

                RI8 - Absenteeism rate of teachers in the payroll - just as the three associated prior actions did not
                 address the underlying problem of poor quality of teaching – only half of teachers were qualified for their
                 position – this results indicator was unrelated to the quality of teaching. The relevance of RI8 is rated
                 moderately unsatisfactory.

  Objective 2 - Improve Transparency in Selected Government Decision-Making Processes

  Fiscal

                RI9 - Share of government accounts with commercial banks - was adequate to measure the impact of
                 the prior action for the Ministry of Finance to direct all government bodies to transfer revenues to the
                 Single Treasury Account by January 31, 2019. Reducing the share of government accounts held at
                 commercial banks to 10 percent would signify a proportionate increase in the share of government
                 revenues transferred to the Single Treasuring Account. The relevance of RI9 is rated satisfactory.
                RI10 - Percentage of new mining leases compliant with the EIRA - was adequate to measure the impact
                 of the prior action for Parliament to enact the Extractive Industries Revenue Act. Passed in July 2018,
                 the legislation required all new mining leases to conform with its provisions. The 100 percent target
                 would mean that all new mining agreements complied with the law without exception. The relevance of
                 RI10 is rated satisfactory.

  Procurement

                RI11 - Share of public procurement transactions conducted through open competition – share of the
                 value of procurement conducted through open competition would have been a better results
                 indicator. The relevance of RI11 is rated moderately satisfactory.

  Anti-Corruption

                RI12 - Share of public officials who have submitted asset declaration forms - would have been an
                 important step toward measuring the impact of the new law and rule requiring the submission of asset,
                 liability, and income declarations by public officials to the ACC, initially by moral suasion (PA24), and
                 subsequently and more effectively, under pain of new sanctions, including criminal penalties (PA25 and
                 PA26). The relevance of RI12 is rated moderately satisfactory.

OBJECTIVE 1
Objective
To create the conditions for increased productivity in selected economic sectors

Rationale
Seeds

        RI1 - The number of private licensed firms in the seed sector was 34 by closing, achieving 340
          percent of the target of 10. The licensed private entities included seed growers, processors, sellers,
          exporters, and importers. Authorities issued provisional licenses in June 2021 and granted full
          licenses after a determination that the licensees met the provisions of the Sierra Leone Seed
          Certification Act of 2017. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had exited the seeds
          and agricultural inputs business altogether. The degree of achievement of the target is rated high.

Fertilizers

        RI2 - No private firms were licensed in the fertilizer sector at closing, failing to achieve the target of
          10. The government received 50 “expressions of interest” from private enterprises but issued no
          licenses. Created in 2020, the NaFRA was not yet fully operational at closing as staff recruitment was
          still ongoing. The degree of achievement of the target at closing would be rated negligible. Data
          provided by the Bank staff after closing indicate that the NaFRA, finally operational and with an
          Executive Director in 2022, granted import permits to 12 dealers, out of 36 applicants, by the third
          quarter of 2022 and planned to issue the Fertilizer Licensing Fee Regulation in the fourth quarter of
          2022. Considering this additional information, the degree of achievement of the target is adjusted to
          modest.

Rice

        RI3 - The average rice yield per hectare rose from 1.1 metric tons in the baseline to 1.74 metric tons
          per hectare by closing, representing 91 percent of the target increase to 1.8 metric tons per
          hectare. However, average yields had risen steadily before adopting the National Rice Policy and the
          Rice Value Chain Strategy in 2020. This reinforces the point that many factors are driving average
          yields apart from policy innovation alone. Moreover, authorities adopted the policy just months before
          the productivity reading. Therefore, crediting the prior actions with the target’s achievement raises
          attribution issues; for this reason, the achievement of the target is rated modest.

Fishing

        RI4 - By project closing, the number of active industrial fishing licenses was reduced from 110 in the
          baseline to 53, achieving 114 percent of the target reduction to 60. Authorities achieved the target
          through (a) restrictions on high-capacity vessels - those over 2,000 in gross registered tonnage were
          prohibited while those between 1,000 and 2,000 gross registered tonnage were seldom approved; (b)
          higher license fees and customs charges; and (c) fines for illegal fishing. Industrial fish production

         was reduced from 123,502 metric tons in 2016 to 120,436 metric tons in 2020. Because of a
         shortcoming with the results indicator, the achievement of the target is rated substantial.

Land

        RI5 - The share of women-owned land plots remained at 20.7 percent at closing, the same as at
         baseline, failing to meet the target increase to 30.7 percent. The achievement of the target is rated
         negligible. According to the ICR, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the enactment by Parliament of
         the Land Commission Bill and the Customary Land Right Bill, drafted with support from
         PA12. According to additional information provided by the Bank staff, the Parliament enacted the two
         bills as the Land Commission Act and the Customary Land Rights Act, both in August 2022, three
         years after this programmatic series closed in October 2019. The two laws were prior actions
         supported by the Inclusive and Sustainable Growth Development Policy Operation (P175342),
         approved in November 2021. No data was available to show whether the share of women-owned
         plots has changed since closing.

Energy

        RI6 - Electricity lost rose from 38 percent of electricity distributed in the baseline to 39 percent by
         closing, failing to meet the target reduction of 28 percent. The EDSA could only partially implement
         the NCOP using available corporate resources and supplemental support from the World Bank - only
         30 percent of the middle and low voltage networks were rehabilitated. The comparatively large
         proportion of total systems losses due to non-technical losses (see Section 4) was also a factor - non-
         technical losses have been rising and were mostly driven by illegal connections and power theft,
         insufficient meters for consumers for new connections, a large number of faulty meters in the system,
         poor commercial billing practices, and the unwillingness of government agencies to transition to pre-
         paid meters. The achievement of the target is rated as negligible.
        RI7 - Government expenditure on fuel subsidy was reduced from 2 percent of GDP in the baseline to
         0 percent by closing, achieving 100 percent of the target reduction to 0 percent of GDP. If the
         objective were fiscal efficiency (i.e., by reducing energy subsidies), the degree of achievement of the
         target would be rated as high. However, because the objective was productivity, the results is not
         rated.

Education

        RI8 - Authorities reduced the rate of absenteeism of teachers on the payroll from 30 percent in the
         baseline to 11.9 percent at closing, achieving by 121 percent the target reduction to 15 percent. The
         ICR adds that school managers had the authority to apply sanctions on absentee teachers,
         temporarily remove chronically absent teachers from the payroll, and deploy tablets and scanners to
         schools to document and monitor teacher attendance. Although the achievement of the target would
         be rated high on this basis, the moderately unsatisfactory ratings for both the relevance of the
         associated prior actions and the relevance of the results indicator warrants a reduction in the rating for
         the degree of achievement of the objective to modest.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To improve transparency in selected government decision-making processes

Rationale
Fiscal

      RI9 - Authorities reduced the percentage of government accounts held at commercial banks from 90
       percent in the baseline to 76.5 percent by closing, achieving only 17 percent of the target reduction to
       10 percent. There were still 1,200 government accounts held at commercial banks at the end of
       October 2021, almost a year after the closing of this programmatic series. The number of government
       accounts held at commercial banks increased for some account categories, including council accounts
       (+12 percent), department accounts (+16 percent), and trust bank accounts (+21 percent). The
       achievement of the target is rated negligible.
      RI10 - The percentage of new mining leases compliant with the Extractive Industries Revenue Act
       of 2018 was 90 percent by closing (2021), achieving 90 percent of the target 100-percent
       compliance. The Ministry of Mines awarded twenty-five mineral rights from July 2018 to December
       2021. The Ministry claims that all new awards complied with the Extractive Industries Revenue
       Act. However, according to the ICR (Annex 6), some government officials dispute this, contending
       that the lease agreements with Kingho Mining Company Limited in 2020 and SL Mining Limited in
       2021 likely breached certain new law provisions. The achievement of the target is rated substantial.

Procurement

      R11- The percentage of public procurement transactions conducted through open competition
         increased from 45 percent in the baseline (2016) to 79.1 percent by closing, achieving 85 percent of
         the target increase of 85 percent. Considering the moderate shortcoming with the indicator, the
         achievement of the target is rated substantial.

Anti-Corruption

      RI12 - The percentage of public officials who submitted their asset declaration forms rose from 20
         percent in the baseline to 80 percent by closing, achieving 86 percent of the target increase to 90
         percent. Following the measures supported by this series, a database of all officials required to
         submit asset declarations was now available in January 2021. Importantly, the ACC filed charges in
         2021 against a former official who did not file his declaration while in office – no conviction has been
         reported so far.[JC1] [AMO2] Additionally, the ACC is reportedly working toward electronic
         submission of all asset declarations (the asset declarations have to be filed annually) but also
         needs resources to [JC3] [AMO4] examine the submissions systematically – the ACC needs data
         analysts to sift through the information. The achievement of the target is rated substantial.

6. Outcome

Rationale

The relevance of prior actions is rated moderately satisfactory. Most of the prior actions (11 of 19) for the
objective to create the conditions for increased productivity in selected economic sectors were satisfactory,
while most of the prior actions (4 of 7) for the objective to improve transparency in selected decision-making
processes were rated moderately satisfactory. In particular, the relevance of most prior actions for the
agriculture and fisheries sector – seeds, fertilizers, fishing, and land – was satisfactory. The relevance of prior
actions in procurement and anti-corruption were mostly moderately satisfactory.

The efficacy is rated moderately satisfactory. The degree of achievement of the objective to create the
conditions for increased productivity in selected economic sectors is rated moderately satisfactory. Similarly, the
achievement of the objective to improve transparency in selected decision-making processes is rated
moderately satisfactory. In particular, the achievement of the targets for seeds and fishing was high. Those for
the fiscal regime for mining, procurement, and anti-corruption were substantial.

The outcome of the programmatic series is rated moderately satisfactory.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Implementation Risks. The sustainability of the reforms advanced by this series depends on whether the new
laws enacted (or the old laws amended) by Parliament will be followed, the new regulations issued will be
observed, the new institutions created will be operationalized, and the new administrative innovations introduced
will be executed. The nature, direction, and degree of the implementation risks vary by reform area.

      The inability of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to operationalize the NaFRA jeopardized
         achieving the target to license at least ten private fertilizer enterprises by the closing
         date. Institutional capacity risk will likely hurt the sustainability of reforms in this sector. However, the
         Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has since reported that the staffing of the NaFRA is underway.
        The risk to the sustainability of development outcomes in fisheries is fairly low because the Ministry of
         Agriculture and Forestry and the military have intensified their surveillance of industrial fishing activity
         and have detained unlicensed vessels. Moreover, a new regional project funded by the European
         Union is now supporting surveillance activity. However, some residual issues remain, including that the
         authorities can only easily track vessels fitted with vessel monitoring systems.
        The EDSA did not make a dent with its technical and commercial loss problems during the
         implementation of this series. Despite the initial set of reforms (PA13, PA14, and PA15), Sierra Leone
         may not likely achieve the objective of creating the conditions for increased productivity in the electricity
         sector if institutional, technical, and financial capacity constraints persist.
        The risk to the sustainability of development outcomes in education is low to moderate. A robust
         inspection and supervision system of secondary school teachers is in place to monitor teacher
         attendance. Apart from recording teacher attendance, the TSC is now considering designing a system to
         evaluate teacher performance. Meanwhile, improving teaching in remote areas remains challenging, and
         the TSC is considering offering incentives to achieve this objective.
        The large number of government agency accounts still held at commercial banks (some 1,200 at the end
         of October 2021) implies that the full implementation of the Single Treasury Account supported by this
         series (PA20) remains distant. Government agencies will have to stop opening new accounts as they
         close old ones, and officers sanctioned if they do.
        Delays with the implementation of the e-procurement system imply that its contribution to the
         transparency objective, much less to the goal to increase open competition in procurement, cannot be
         readily ascertained.
        Although 86 percent of government officials and related parties filing asset declarations as required by
         law and with sanctions imposed for non-compliance, the risk to the sustainability of this anti-corruption
         outcome is likely high. The ability to obtain court judgements is likely weak. Moreover, for the asset
         declaration system to become an effective anti-corruption measure, the authorities will need to advance
         the reform by, for example, introducing a system to audit the declarations even on a statistical sampling
         basis, which will need considerable funding.

Mitigation Measures. New legislation by Parliament and a new operation by the Bank will help mitigate some
of the risks to the sustainability of the development outcomes of this series.

      The Land Commission Bill and the Customary Land Right Bill that the Ministry of Lands submitted,
         Housing, and Country Planning to the Cabinet as part of this series (PA12), were finally enacted by
         Parliament into law as the National Land Commission Act of 2021 and the Customary Land Right Act of
         2021. Meanwhile, the Government has submitted to Parliament the Mines and Minerals Development
         Bill (originally a trigger for the third operation but deferred for lack of stakeholder and public discussion

                                                                                                        Page 26 of 32

       after the outbreak of COVID-19) that would provide the legal framework for promoting governance,
       transparency, fiscal, social and environmental standards for the mines and minerals sector. As with any
       legislation, the real challenge is implementing the laws once they are passed.
      The Sierra Leone First Inclusive Sustainable Growth Financing Development Policy Operation (175342)
       was approved in December 2021 and aims to improve natural resources governance, enhance
       inclusiveness, and improve the sustainability of development financing. Among eight prior actions, those
       advancing the objectives of this programmatic series include the: (a) development and rollout of the
       Teacher Management Information System by the TSC; (b) amendment of the Payment Systems Act to
       facilitate electronic payments; (d) submission to Parliament of the draft Mines and Mineral Act to provide
       a legal framework for the governance, transparency norms, fiscal regime, and environmental and social
       standards for the mines and minerals sector; and (d) publication by the NPPA of tender awards and
       contracts in the education and health sectors.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Analytical Foundations. The reform program supported by this series reflected significant analytical work by
the Bank, other development institutions, and the Government. The Program Documents and the ICR (Table 8)
cite 29 studies and reports that informed the prior actions, apart from the SCD of 2018 and the Sierra
Leone Third Generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2013 – 2018) - The Agenda for Prosperity of 2013,
which were important to most of the reform areas.

      Twenty studies pertaining to the first policy pillar (PA1 - PA19) contributed the following insights and
       recommendations: (a) agriculture suffered from very low access to improved seeds and fertilizers and
       low incentives for the private sector’s participation in the seed and the fertilizer markets; (b) rice offered a
       good potential for driving agriculture sector growth; (c) the land tenure system needed to provide for
       sufficient security and safeguards of land ownership and leasehold and increase the access to land
       by vulnerable groups, especially women; (d) large numbers of industrial vessels and illegal, unreported,
       and unregulated fishing threatened fisheries resources; (e) the electricity sector was not sustainable
       because of low-cost recovery, a weak governance structure, high technical and commercial losses (at
       about 38 percent); and low revenue collections (around 60 percent of total sales); (f) learning outcomes
       were among the lowest in the region, reflecting in part the poor qualification standards (only half of
       teachers were qualified for their position), performance, and management of the teaching workforce.

Although not listed among the 20 studies, Policies and Actions to Stimulate Private Sector Marketing of
Fertilizers in Sub-Saharan Africa (Kelly and Crawford, U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 2007) underlies
the thinking behind the prior actions of the first policy pillar (PA1 - PA6) which posit that private participation in
critical input markets increases the uptake by farmers of these inputs. According to the study (which
“synthesizes literature reviewed to characterize lessons learned from reform over the past two decades” ):,
“There is reasonable agreement regarding measures needed to establish enabling conditions that stimulate
both demand for and supply of fertilizer. Measures include building institutions to promote competition while
improving supply chain efficiency, investing in transportation and market infrastructure, investing in research

                                                                                                       Page 27 of 32

and extension, managing price and production risk, facilitating rural finance, and strengthening legal and
regulatory institutions. Improvements in each of these areas will contribute to improved profitability of fertilizer
use by reducing input costs, raising or stabilizing producer prices, and improving fertilizer use efficiency.” Nine
studies on the second policy pillar (PA20 - PA26) contributed the following insights and recommendations:
(a) weak procurement management resulted in higher prices paid on purchases of goods and services and
works contracts; (b) the perception of corruption in Sierra Leone was high; and (c) more effective asset
disclosure would reduce corruption. Linkages with Other Bank Operations. The programmatic series
complemented other concurrent Bank operations in Sierra Leone.

      In agriculture, the series complemented the Smallholder Commercialization and Agribusiness
         Development Project Additional Financing (P153437 [2016-21] and P170604 [2020-23]), which aimed
         to promote smallholder commercialization by fostering productive business linkages between smallholder
         farmers and selected agribusiness firms and other commodity off-takers.
        In fishing, the series complemented the West Africa Region Fisheries Program for Guinea, Liberia, and
         Sierra Leone - Additional Financing (P126773 [2015-22]), which aimed to strengthen the governance and
         management of targeted fisheries and improve the handling of landed catch at selected sites.
        In energy, the series complimented the Energy Sector Utility Reform Project (P120304 [2013-22]), which
         aimed to improve the operational performance of the national electricity distribution utility, the Western
         Area Power Generation Project for Sierra Leone (P153805 [2016-19]) which aimed to increase the power
         generated by independent power producers and to mobilize private capital for electricity services, and
         the Enhancing Sierra Leone Energy Access Project (P171059 [2021-25]) which aimed to increase
         electricity access.
        In education, the series complemented the Revitalizing Education Development Project (P133070 [2016-
         19]), which aimed to improve the learning environment in targeted schools and establish systems for
         monitoring education interventions and outcomes.
        On fiscal policy and public financial management, the series complimented the Public Financial
         Management Improvement and Consolidation Project (P133424, 2013-21), which aimed to improve
         budget planning and credibility, financial control, accountability, and the oversight of government
         finances and the Extractives Industries Technical Assistance Project Phase II (P160719, 2017-22) which
         aimed to strengthen the governance, knowledge, and sustainability of the extractives sector.

Donor Coordination. The Bank collaborated closely with the Development Partnership Committee, the main
platform for consultations between government and its development partners, including the International
Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, European Union, International Fund for Agriculture and
Development, Food and Agriculture Organization, UN Resident Coordinator’s Office, UK Department for
International Development, and US Agency for International Development. According to the ICR, the partners
conducted joint missions, deliberated on structural reforms and macro-fiscal and financial sector issues, and
collaborated on budget support during program design and implementation.

Adaptation. The Bank introduced various changes to the program throughout this series, from the appraisal of
the first operation in June 2017 to that of the third in May 2020.

      The Bank modified the first program objective from “increasing productivity in selected economic sectors”
       to “creating the conditions for increased productivity in selected economic sectors.” The change was
       logical considering that productivity gains take time to be realized, much less measured, likely longer
       than the three-year duration of this series.
      The Bank either dropped or modified several triggers (which would have become prior actions for a
       succeeding operation) in response to changed conditions: (a) the reinstatement of the excise duty on rice
       (by applying the Economic Community of West African States’ tariff on the commodity) was dropped
       because the government feared that re-imposing the tariff on a food staple immediately after the
       liberalization of fuel prices would spike inflation and trigger social unrest; (b) the enactment by Parliament
       of the Regulations for the National Fertilizer Regulatory Agency Act of 2017 was downshifted to the
       preparation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the same regulations; (c) the roll-out of an
       integrated Web-based e-procurement platform to three agencies in a pilot scheme and later to five
       agencies was dropped and transferred instead to the Public Financial Management Improvement and
       Consolidation Project - the programmatic series focused on the legal framework for e-procurement; (d)
       the publication of an audit report on procurement in 2016 was converted to the submission by the
       National Public Procurement Authority to Parliament of the Public Procurement Regulations of 2020; (e)
       the adoption of a new minerals policy to facilitate the Amendment of the Mines and Minerals Act of 2009
       was dropped and transferred to a future development policy operation as the government did not have
       sufficient time to conduct consultations with stakeholders and the public about the policy following the
       outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (f) the publication by the Anti-Corruption Commission of a
       report on corruption was converted to the enactment of the Amendment to the Anti-Corruption Act of
       2008 – the Government felt that strengthening the anti-corruption regime by law was a stronger prior
       action, according to the ICR.
      To the Bank’s credit, it introduced reforms not originally part of the series but which would make for a
       stronger economic reform program in general, albeit, in the case of fuel pricing and subsidies, outside the
       original productivity and transparency objectives of this series: (a) the Bank added eliminating subsidies
       on petroleum products and adopting an automatic fuel price indexation formula (PA16) to improve the
       sustainability of the energy sector – this reform evidently had fiscal objectives (see Section 3.B); (b) the
       Bank added issuance by the Ministry of Finance of a directive for ministries, departments, and agencies
       to transfer all revenue collections to the Singe Treasury Account (PA20) in response to the finding by the
       Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability report of 2017 that revenues retained by the agencies in
       commercial bank accounts amounted to more than 10 percent of the budget of 2016; (c) the Bank added
       enactment by Parliament of the Extractive Industry Revenue Act of 2018 (PA21) to strengthen the fiscal
       regime for the mining sector.
      The Bank raised the financing for the third operation from an average of SDR 25.3 million (US$35 million
       equivalent) for the first two in the series to SDR 73.2 million (US$100 million) for the third. The Bank
       made the change in response to the budgetary financing needs of Sierra Leone following the outbreak of
       the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In April 2020, the government estimated a fiscal deficit (after
       grants) of 5.4 percent of GDP for 2020 (from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2019), which would have to be
       covered by external financing of up to 1.2 percent of GDP (the Bank approved the third operation in June
       2020).

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR stated that the increase in fuel prices (PA16 eliminated the subsidies on petroleum products and
adopted the automatic fuel price indexation formula) raised public transportation costs by 30 percent in 2021
and helped drive non-food inflation higher from 4.5 percent in June 2021 to 7.5 percent in August 2021,
negatively affecting the urban poor in particular. Other than the rise in transport and non-food costs, the ICR did
not cite any additional ex-post social and poverty impact, stating that either: (a) some reforms “could” have a
positive effect on the poor - “agriculture and fisheries reforms could improve food security and reduce
malnutrition and vulnerability to food price shocks;” or (b) some benefits have yet to accrue to be measurable -
“reforms have been successful in the seed markets, with fertilizer markets lagging but expected to benefit from
private sector participation over time through increased access to improved inputs;” or (c) some reforms have
not advanced for benefits to be realized - “support to an improved system for land management ... is planned to
be implemented with delay.”



b. Environmental

The ICR did not cite any ex-post environmental impacts of this series. The ICR simply stated that the “indication
thus far is that environmental and social impacts will be moderate and, in most cases, manageable.”



c. Gender

The target to raise the raise of women-owned land plots to 30.7 percent was not achieved; the share remained
the same at closing as in the baseline, 20.7 percent.

d. Other

---
10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

Consistency with Guidelines. The ICR is consistent with OPCS guidelines on ICRs for development financing
operations and includes sections on the relevance of prior actions and the relevance of results indicators.

Conciseness. The account of the project’s performance is well informed and concisely presented.

Results Orientation. The efficacy assessment is outcome-oriented and based on the degree of achievement of
the results targets.

Quality of Evidence. The ICR presents ample evidence to support its assessment of the Bank’s performance at
design. There is no discussion of Bank performance during implementation.

Quality of Analysis. The assessment of the efficacy of the program is candid. While the government fulfilled
all prior actions, the program failed to deliver on some final-step measures that would have delivered the results
targets (e.g., full operationalization of the NaFRA).

Lessons. The ICR draws lessons that would be valuable to reform programs that require firm and credible
decisions by the government, are difficult to implement with the limited institutional capacity of implementing
agencies or may not be readily acceptable under a difficult political environment.

Three lessons from the ICR are critical, with some adaptation.

A firm commitment by the government to exit an industry in favor of the private sector can help
encourage private enterprises to enter, invest, and do business in the industry. In this series, the passage
by Parliament of the Sierra Leone Seed Certification Act of 2017 and the issuance by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry of the Seed Certification Agency Regulations of 2020 helped firm up a government decision to exit
the agriculture inputs market and to promote the production, multiplication, and distribution of seeds by the
private sector instead. By the closing date, authorities licensed thirty-four private enterprises to operate as seed
growers, processors, sellers, exporters, and importers. A similar strategy for fertilizers followed the adoption by
the Cabinet of a new fertilizer policy in 2017 to progressively reduce the public sector’s role and encourage the
private sector to supply and distribute fertilizers instead. Only the slow organization of the NaFRA created by
the National Fertilizer Regulatory Agency Act of 2017 stalled the licensing of private fertilizer firms. However, at
least 50 private enterprises had submitted expressions of interest.

Reform measures can succeed better if they reflect the implementing agency’s institutional, technical,
and financial capacity. In this series, systems losses were not reduced to 28 percent as targeted but rose from
38 in the baseline to 39 percent at closing. The EDSA only partially implemented the NCOP using its available
corporate resources and supplemental resources provided by the Bank. The EDSA rehabilitated only 30
percent of medium-voltage and low-voltage networks in the electric power distribution system, handicapping the
effort to reduce technical losses by about ten percentage points. Moreover, the EDSA could not procure and
install bulk meters in time under a separate project to reduce commercial losses. This measure was not part of
this series but would have helped reduce total systems losses. According to the ICR, the Bank overestimated
the capacity of the EDSA to implement the reforms.

Consistent and dedicated preparatory work on reform legislation can eventually pay off even if the
initial political environment was not conducive to the reform effort. In this series, the Extractive
Industries Revenue Bill had been deadlocked in Parliament since 2014, three years before the approval of the
first operation in 2017. However, the government bureaucracy persisted in arguing the merits of unifying the
fiscal regime for the mineral sector, which suffered from inconsistency, lack of transparency, and poor efficacy in
raising mineral revenues to their estimated potential. The Bank included the bill’s passage as a prior action of
the second series, and the enactment by Parliament of the Extractive Industries Revenue Act of 2018 fulfilled
the prior action. According to the ICR, the dedicated work by the bureaucracy was instrumental in advancing the
reform process until a new government, elected into office in the general election of 2018, was sufficiently
convinced to support the reform objective and the proposed legislation.
