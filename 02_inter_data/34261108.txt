a. Objectives
   The project development objective (PDO) was "to strengthen local governments’ capacity and extractive
   sector management for service delivery in the targeted regions." (PAD, p. 9).

   For the purposes of this ICRR the PDO is unpacked into two PDOs to be assessed separately:

           PDO 1: to strengthen local governments’ capacity for service delivery in the targeted regions; and


                                                                                                      Page 1 of 18

d. Components
   Component 1: Strengthening Local Governments’ Capacities (Approved: US $59 million, Actual: $23
   million): This component aimed to enhance systems and capacities within local governments through
   TA. The goal was to reinforce state deployment policies and encourage the availability of public financing at
   the local level. The project component consisted of two sub-components:

   Sub-component 1.1 focused on strengthening systems for resource deployment and improving the
   performance of local governments. It involved: (1) Human Resource Management (HRM) TA, which
   included developing local civil service management manuals and procedures, training local government
   staff, and overseeing civil servants in collaboration with CFGCT. This included defining a capacity-building
   strategy and plan, training trainers, revising curricula, and enhancing the capacity of the CFGCT in
   management. Secondly, this sub-component involved two Public Financial Management (PFM) TAs, which
   encompassed preparing the legal framework and procedures for the decentralized management of public
   resources and local government financing, following the directives of the Western-Africa Economic and
   Monetary Union (WAEMU). This involved drafting legal texts and procedures for budgeting, execution, and
   reporting on sectoral transfers and extractive revenue to local governments. It also included implementing
   the Treasury Single Account (TSA) e-system at the local level. Third, this sub-component involved three
   Local governance and risk monitoring systems, which included designing and implementing two information
   management systems. One was for monitoring LG management, covering aspects like HRM and PFM, and
   included the collection of perception data on service delivery. The other system monitored drivers of conflict
   and violence and was managed by the National Center for Strategic Security Studies (CNESS), which
   included conducting perception surveys.

   Sub-component 1.2 was dedicated to Performance-Based Contracts (PBCs) designed to encourage the
   efficient deployment of public resources, both human and financial, at the local level in the targeted regions
   and sectors. This component aimed to incentivize resource mobilization for the effective implementation of
   deployment activities.

   The first restructuring (approved on October 6, 2021) primarily impacted Component 1, “Strengthening
   Local Governments’ Capacities.” The objectives of this component remained intact, but certain Performance
   Based Results (PBRs) deadlines were shifted by one year, except for those related to the COVID-19
   response, which had already been achieved. Additionally, unused Project Preparation Advance
   (PPA) balances were reallocated into Category 1, and project disbursement estimates were updated within
   this component.

Component 2: Improving Extractive Sector’s Management (Approved: US$37 million, Actual: $4
million). Within this component, TA was provided to enhance the management and investment
attractiveness of the extractive sector. The focus was on integrating the extractive sector effectively into the
local economy. This component utilized Performance-Based Contracts (PBCs) to encourage public
financing for registering and training Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) miners, as well as increasing
oversight on mining sites. This project component consisted of two sub-components:

Sub-Component 2.1: Under Sub-component 2.1, efforts were made to improve extractive sector
management. This included updating the legal and policy framework, enhancing regulatory capacity, and
integrating the sector into the local economy through improved local content and ASM capacity. TA was
provided for: (i) Regulatory framework: this involved updating legal and policy frameworks, building
capacity, and developing long-term socio-economic and environmental government strategies without
financing mining closure activities. (ii) Geo-data management: support was provided to acquire, process,
and disseminate information about the country's subsoil, identify artisanal mining zones, and develop an
integrated information management system for the extractive sector. (iii) ASM management: efforts were
made to formalize the gold ASM value chain, provide training for public officials, establish training and
demonstration centers for environmentally sound mining practices, and support the organization for Women
in Extractives in Niger (AFSIEN).

Sub-component 2.2: This subcomponent focused on implementing effective oversight of the extractive
sector, from ASM to Large Scale Mining (LSM) sites, with the goal of improving social, environmental, and
fiscal compliance. PBCs were utilized to mobilize resources for this purpose.

Component 3. Project Management and Coordination (Approved: US$4 million, Actual: $3
million): This component was designed to support the overall implementation and coordination of the
project, ensuring that activities across the various components were effectively implemented. The
component supported: (i) day-to-day management of the project; (ii) procurement and financial
management; (iii) monitoring and evaluation (M&E); (iv) coordination of project activities; (v) communication;
(vi) support of training and advisory services needed for the overall performance of the project; and (vii)
leadership and change management to address collaboration and cooperation challenges, e.g., through
coaching on Rapid Result approach within targeted ministries. There were two restructurings as follows:

Restructuring No. 1: On October 6, 2021, the restructuring entailed a change in the results framework and a
reallocation between disbursement categories.

Restructuring No. 2: The second restructuring (approved on April 1, 2023) involved significant changes in
project timelines (loan closing date), cancellation of financing, and reallocation between disbursement
categories, affecting all three component costs. The GoN formally requested the second restructuring due
to underperformance, as highlighted in the Mid-Term Review (MTR) conducted in November
2022.Recommendations from the MTR suggested that the project would not meet its PDO and the original
Theory of Change. The main changes are as follows:

    1. Project Closing Date: The project closing date was advanced from July 31, 2025, to March 31, 2023.
    2. Cancellation of Financing: US$70 million of the total financing amount was canceled, necessitating
       revisions in project component costs.
    3. Change to Components:



                                                                                                   Page 3 of 18

     GOLD & COVID-19 response (P164271)



         Component 1: “Strengthening Local Governments’ Capacities,” saw a reduction from US$59 million
          to US$23 million;
         Component 2: “Improving Extractive Sector’s Management,” was reduced from US$37 million to
          US$4 million, and;
         Component 3: “Project Management and Coordination,” decreased from US$4 million to US$3
          million.

   These adjustments were essential to align the project with the revised expectations from the MTR. The
   restructuring aimed to recalibrate the project's ambitious goals in light of the challenges encountered during
   the implementation. The October 2021 restructuring did not address the issues with the institutional
   anchoring of the project, its unrealistic level of ambition, the inappropriate targets, and the excessive
   number of indicators. Despite these challenges, the core objectives of strengthening local governance
   capacities, improving extractive sector management, and ensuring effective project management and
   coordination were maintained across all components, albeit with reduced resources and ambition.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
   Project Cost: The project was estimated to cost US$ 100 million. The Actual cost was $27,296,054.

   Financing: The Bank financed the project with a US$ 27,296,054 IDA credit.

   Borrower Contribution: The Borrower did not contribute any funds.

   The project was approved on August 3, 2020, and became effective on March 31, 2021. The project
   was restructured in October 2021 and again on April 1, 2023, with the latter setting an earlier project closure
   date of March 31, 2023 (instead of July 31, 2025). The October 2021 restructuring aimed to align the project
   with its initial implementation timeline, addressing delays without altering the project's design, PDO, or
   indicators. In contrast, the April 2023 restructuring, prompted by the Mid-Term Review (MTR), resulted from
   the project's underperformance. As stated, the MTR indicated that the project would not achieve its PDO
   and original Theory of Change. As a result, the project was closed early. The project concluded on March
   31, 2023, with an actual disbursement of $27.3 million, contrasting with the revised budget of $29.5 million
   and the initial projected cost of $100 million.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Background: In 2020, Niger's economy faced challenges due to health, climate, and security crises,
leading to a growth slowdown. Real growth, which was 5.9% in 2019, fell to 3.6% in 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks, and disruptions in cereal production. The extractive sector,
contributing 6.8% to GDP in 2019, faced sudden commodity price fluctuations (World Bank, Niger
Economic Update, April 2021). Economic downturn in Nigeria and border closure further impacted growth.
The economy was expected to rebound in 2021, growing at 5.5%, driven by border reopening, large
investments, and supply chain normalization (ICR, p. 1). The economic challenges led to a 0.2% reduction

                                                                                                     Page 4 of 18

in per capita income and increased poverty to 41.7%, with 400,000 more people falling into extreme poverty
in 2020 due to job losses and lower remittances. COVID-19 also negatively affected human capital.

Institutional Context (Addressing Fragility, Conflict, and COVID-19 Challenges: Niger's Reforms in
Decentralization and Extractive Sector Management): The Government of Niger (GoN) faced significant
challenges related to Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
These challenges were recognized in Niger's Second Economic and Social Development Plan 2017-2021
(PDES-II), which identified insecurity as a major obstacle to economic, social, and cultural development. In
response, the PDES-II proposed strategies to improve security governance, mitigate security threats,
reduce community conflicts, and promote development initiatives for peace and security. Additionally, the
GoN declared a state of emergency and implemented non- sanitary measures (border closure, schools
closing, lockdown and curfews) to address the impact of COVID-19.

To address the issues of fragility and instability, the GoN adopted reforms aimed at improving the
deployment and decentralization of public resources, particularly in the education, health, water, and
environment sectors. However, the implementation of these reforms, as well as the transfer of service
delivery responsibilities and extractive revenue-sharing arrangements, faced slow implementation, lack of
clarity in roles and responsibilities across government levels, and limited human resource capacity and
training at the local government level.

Furthermore, the extractive regions of Agadez, Diffa, Tillabery, and Zinder, which accounted for a significant
portion of the country's mining revenues, were facing fragility challenges. Weak extractive sector
management in these regions contributed to fragility risks, as the majority of the Artisanal and Small-scale
Mining (ASM) value chain operated informally, frequently entailing social and environmental risks. Despite
the substantial revenue potential in these regions, slow progress in legal and institutional reforms hampered
private sector investment.

In this context, the project focused on deploying public resources through decentralization to improve local
government capacity, enhance service delivery, and coordinate COVID-19 responses beyond the capital
city of Niamey. Additionally, the project aimed to attract investors by improving geo-data and extractive
sector management, mitigating associated social and environmental risks, fostering job creation, and
increasing revenue mobilization. Formalizing Artisanal and small-scale Mining (ASM) and enhancing
oversight capacity were also key components of the project, aimed at making the sector more resilient and
fostering accountability. Overall, the project's objectives included increasing transparency, promoting
participation in local governance and extractive industries, and strengthening accountability and state
credibility in Niger.

Alignment with World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF): The project was aligned
with the CPF for the Republic of Niger on decentralization, governance, fragility, and extractives10. Niger’s
CPF for the period FY18- 22. The latter emphasized the role of governance and a well-managed extractive
sector

to: (i) ensure transparency, accountability, and transfers of extractive revenue to LGs; (ii) mitigate FCV
risks; (iii) increase revenue mobilization; (iv) promote private-sector development and job creation; and (v)
adopt a citizen-centric approach to improve service delivery. The project was expected to contribute to
these objectives.

               In particular, the project was expected to address structural drivers of fragility by enhancing positive state
               presence, preventing conflict, fostering inclusiveness at the local level, improving extractive sector
               management, and supporting local livelihoods, especially in ASM. By increasing local capacity, the project
               strengthened the GoN’s governance, service delivery, and extractive sector activities, maximizing the
               positive impact of extractive industries on poverty reduction through job creation and revenue mobilization.

               Contribution to GoN’s Covid-19 Response Plan: Finally, the project contributed directly to the GoN’s
               response plan to the COVID-19 pandemic. It operationalized local COVID-19 crisis management cells,
               especially in extractive regions. In the mid-term, the project enhanced COVID-19 resilience by improving
               service delivery, mobilizing revenue from the extractive sector, and creating jobs, particularly in ASM. This
               approach addressed the economic impact of the pandemic and encouraged alternative livelihoods, aligning
               with the nation's efforts to combat the challenges posed by COVID-19.

                             Objective
                             To strengthen local governments’ capacity for service delivery in the targeted regions

                             Rationale
                             The ICR presents the project’s theory of change (ToC), with a diagrammatic description of the results chain,
                             indicating the linkages between outputs and outcomes. The ToC for this project aimed to address critical
                             challenges in local governance, focusing on enhancing local government's service delivery and effective
                             resource utilization in targeted regions. The central problem was insufficient access to essential services such
                             as water, primary education, and healthcare due to inefficiencies in local governance structures. The ToC
                             outlined a strategic framework that included increasing Human Resource (HR) capacity, improving spending
                             in social sectors, enhancing oversight mechanisms, and conducting in-depth conflict risk analysis.

                             Proposed Output 1 concentrated on empowering local governments through enhanced HR capacity, conflict
                             resolution skills, and transparent citizen engagement. Proposed Output 2 aimed at increasing spending in
                             critical sectors (Primary Education, Health, and Water) to bolster service accessibility. Output 3 and 4
                             emphasized strengthening oversight both within local governments and at the ministry level, ensuring
                             efficient resource utilization and effective emergency responses. Output 5 focused on improving conflict risk
                             analysis, a crucial aspect of maintaining stability and community resilience.

                             Given the challenges identified, the project's interventions were expected to address these issues
                             comprehensively. However, the optimism bias in the initial ToC at the design stage led to unmet objectives
                             and inefficiencies.

The outputs, while well-intentioned, lacked specificity, leading to a gap between aspirations and actual
outcomes. Concrete activities necessary to achieve specified PDO indicators in health, education, and water
were not outlined. (This oversight also became evident during the project's implementation phase due to the
lack of specificity in the TOC). For instance, the failure to reduce the student-teacher ratio to the targeted 41
percent demonstrated the need for a more granular approach in planning and execution. Similarly, the goal of
transferring 15 percent of mining revenues from the central government to local governments lacked a
realistic approach, as it overlooked the environment with respect to insecurity, the regulatory framework,
capacity, and comparative performance in the sub-region. Indeed, the target of transfer by the central
government of 15 percent of (mining) revenues to local governments had not been implemented or achieved
in any country of the region despite decades of fiscal decentralization. All countries initially adopted an
incremental approach and implemented confidence-building measures, providing support to enhance local
government capacity alongside a gradually expanding process of fiscal decentralization. However, the TOC
did not leverage lessons from these prior projects in neighboring countries, (ICR, p. vi).

In total, there were nine IRIs related to Objective 1.

      IRI 1.1: Public Officials Trained on LG’s PFM & HRM, Conflict Mediation & Citizen Engagement: IRI
         1.1 tracked the number of public officials trained in Local Government's Public Financial Management
         (PFM) & Human Resource Management (HRM), conflict mediation, and citizen engagement. The
         target was 5,000 officials, of which women were to be included. The baseline number trained was 0,
         the actual number (not surveyed) was not available, and the target was not met due to activities not
         being started. (Not Achieved).
        IRI 1.2: National Report on Drivers of Conflict: IRI 1.2 aimed to produce 4 national reports analyzing
         the drivers of conflict, including perceptions. The baseline number of reports produced was 0, the
         actual number was 0, and the target was not met due to activities not being initiated. (Not Achieved)
        IRI 1.3: Municipality's Own Tax Recovery Rate IRI 1.3 assessed the percentage of the municipality's
         own tax recovery rate. The baseline rate was 30%, the actual rate (not communicated) was not
         available, and the target was 60%. This indicator was not met due to lack of communicated data. (Not
         Achieved)
        IRI 1.4: Beneficiaries' Satisfaction: IRI 1.4 measured the percentage of beneficiaries' satisfaction,
         particularly women. The baseline satisfaction rate was 0% (not surveyed), the actual rate (not
         conducted) was not available, and the target was 70%. This indicator was not met due to the survey
         not being conducted. (Not Achieved)
        IRI 1.5: Citizens' Awareness of Municipality's Investment Projects: IRI 1.5 measured the percentage of
         citizens in targeted regions, specifically women, who were aware of their municipality's annual
         investment projects plan and perceived it aligning with their priorities. The baseline awareness was
         0%, the actual awareness (not surveyed) was not available, and the target was 70%. This indicator
         was not met due to the survey not being conducted. (Not Achieved)
        IRI 1.6: Inter-ministerial Decision on Extractive Revenues: IRI 1.6 assessed the adoption of an inter-
         ministerial decision on modalities for the allocation and execution of extractive revenues. The
         baseline
        status was "No," indicating the decision had not been adopted. The actual status was "Yes," signifying
         successful adoption. The target was met, and associated funds of EUR 3.6 million were disbursed.
         (Achieved)
        IRI 1.7: Increased Spending of Targeted Municipalities in Targeted Sectors: IRI 1.7 aimed to track the
         percentage increase in spending by targeted municipalities in specific sectors. The baseline spending

       increase was 0% (not tracked), the actual increase was not available, and the target was 200%. This
       indicator was not met because the tracking was not conducted. (Not Achieved)
      IRI 1.8: Effective Central-Local COVID-19 Emergency Response Coordination Mechanism: IRI 1.8
       assessed the establishment of an effective central-local COVID-19 emergency response coordination
       mechanism. The baseline status was "No," indicating the absence of such a mechanism. The actual
       status was "Yes," indicating successful establishment. The target was met, and associated funds of
       EUR 10.8 million were disbursed. (Achieved)
      IRI 1.9: Implementation of Inspection Recommendations by Public Entities: IRI 1.9 measured the
       number of public entities inspected in the previous calendar year that implemented 70% or more of
       inspection recommendations in CY22 and CY23. The baseline number of entities meeting this
       criterion was 0 (not tracked), the actual number was not available, and the target was 300. This
       indicator was not met due to lack of tracking. (Not Achieved)

Thus, two of the nine IRIs associated with Objective 1 were achieved. The project successfully adopted an
inter-ministerial decision for extractive revenues and established an efficient COVID-19 emergency response
system, verified by the Independent Verification Agent (IVA) and leading to disbursement of allocated PBR
funds. These accomplishments are vital steps for decentralization reform, particularly in improving COVID-19
response coordination and mining sector oversight. The linkage of PBC to these achievements created
incentives and fiscal space for decentralization and extractive sector reforms, though challenges arose due to
early closure, procurement delays, and insecurity, leading to unmet objectives and data deficiencies in seven
other related IRIs.

Additionally, the project's success was measured through 5 PDO indicators:

PDO 1: Increased access to water in the targeted regions: The project aimed to increase access to
drinkable water points, with a baseline of 30.60 percent. By the project's closing in 2021, the actual access
had significantly improved to 48.59 percent, surpassing the targeted goal of 40 percent. This accomplishment
highlighted a substantial achievement in enhancing water accessibility for the communities in the targeted
regions. (High).

PDO 2: Increased access to education in the targeted regions: This objective focused on reducing the
student-teacher ratio, with a baseline ratio of 31.30 percent. Unfortunately, the actual ratio at the project's
closing in 2021 remained at 41 percent, missing the targeted objective of below 41 percent. Despite efforts,
this goal was not met, indicating a challenge in optimizing the education system in the targeted regions.
(Negligible).

PDO 3: Increased access to health services in the targeted regions: The aim was to ensure integrated
health centers within 5km for the population, with a baseline of 52.52 percent. Although there was a slight
increase to 53.6 percent by 2021, the target of 60 percent was not achieved. This outcome revealed a gap in
improving healthcare accessibility, emphasizing the need for more focused strategies in the health sector.
(Negligible).

PDO 4: Improved municipalities' budget execution rate in the targeted regions: The objective was to
enhance the budget execution rate to 50 percent. Unfortunately, no data was available at the project's
closing, making it impossible to assess progress against the target. The absence of this crucial information
highlighted a significant challenge in monitoring financial performance at the municipal level. (Negligible).



                                                                                                    Page 8 of 18

PDO 5: Increased Extractive Revenues Transferred to Local Governments (LGs): The project aimed to
increase the percentage of extractive revenues transferred to Local Governments (LGs) with a targeted goal
of 65 percent. Despite this objective, the actual transfers remained at 54 percent, falling short of the target.
Surprisingly, no transfers were made, indicating a significant gap between the intended outcomes and the
actual implementation, leading to a non-achievement of this PDO indicator. The absence of these crucial fund
transfers emphasized a fundamental challenge in the project's objective of enhancing local governance
through increased fiscal resources. (Negligible).

In summary, the project made notable progress in increasing access to water, but faced challenges in
optimizing education, healthcare, and financial management in the targeted regions. While achievements
were observed, the unmet objectives underscored the complexities faced during implementation. Out of the
five PDO indicators, only achieved one indicator (access to drinkable water points), surpassing the target of
40 percent by reaching 48.59 percent. However, the four other PDO indicators related to Objective were not
achieved, and the associated Performance-Based Results (PBRs) were not disbursed.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To strengthen extractive sector management for service delivery in the targeted regions

Rationale
The Theory of Change (TOC) for the second objective was developed in response to significant challenges
plaguing Niger's extractive sector. Outdated regulations, limited implementation capacities, lax oversight,
inadequate geological knowledge, and marginalized artisanal miners underscored the pressing problems. The
proposed outputs were strategically designed to confront these issues head-on. The TOC sought to address
the following problems:

      Legal and Policy Framework Enhancement: Addressing the sector's outdated regulations,
       proposed output 1 focused on aligning policies with global standards. It aimed to bolster fiscal
       accountability, environmental sustainability, and adherence to international social standards.
      Capacity Building for Implementation: To counter the sector's implementation gaps, proposed output
       2 concentrated on empowering officials. Specialized training programs were devised to equip them
       with the skills necessary for effective policy enforcement, ensuring regulations were not just on paper
       but actively adhered to.
      Mining Site Oversight Strengthening: Weak oversight mechanisms were a pervasive issue. The third
       intended output sought to rectify it by introducing stringent monitoring practices. This would guarantee
       compliance with crucial social, environmental, and fiscal standards, fostering responsible mining
       practices.
      Geological Potential Understanding: Inadequate understanding of geological resources posed a
       challenge. The proposed fourth output aimed to rectify this by initiating systematic data collection and
       analysis in priority zones. A more profound grasp of the country's mineral potential would facilitate
       informed decision-making.

                                                                                                  Page 9 of 18

      Artisanal Miner Empowerment: Empowering marginalized artisanal miners, especially women, was a
         priority. The fifth output aimed to provide training in environmental best practices, essential business
         skills, and promote gender equality within the sector.

Through these focused outputs, the TOC aimed not only to address these challenges but to transform the
extractive sector into a more accountable, sustainable, and inclusive sector. However, this vision faced
numerous challenges rooted in the TOC's complexity, lack of robust analytical foundation, and an optimism
bias. The Results Framework, while intricate, led to confusion and discrepancies in indicators and targets.
Unrealistic objectives, such as a 200 percent increase in LG annual spending, made achievements
unattainable. The TOC struggled to align global standards with local realities, further complicated by limited
resources. Critical assumptions, pivotal for the project's success, were not thoroughly examined, leading to an
optimism bias.

In total, there were 9 IRIs associated with Objective 2:

      IRI 2.1: The geographical coverage of geological knowledge did not meet the 20.86 percent target.
         (Not Achieved, Data not communicated).
      IRI 2.2: The adoption of a mine closure strategy was in progress but not yet completed. (Not
         Achieved, Data not communicated).
        IRI 2.3: The adoption of Local content strategy for extractives was in progress, but not yet completed.
         (Not Achieved, Data not communicated).
        IRI 2.4: The objective to increase women leadership in targeted ASM sites to 30 percent was not met.
         (Not Achieved).
        IRI 2.5: EITI compliance to the new standard was in progress but not yet achieved. (Not Achieved).
        IRI 2.6: Perceptions of extractive firms on the legal system and geo-data management encouraging
         investment did not reach the 50 percent target. (Not Achieved).
        IRI 2.7: Grievances received and addressed timely by the project did not meet the 70 percent
         target. (Not Achieved).
        IRI 2.8 (PBC 7): The goal of increased impact of mining sites' inspection was not achieved, falling
         short of the 150 target. (Not Achieved).
        IRI 2.9 (PBC 8): The objective of increased formalization of artisanal and small-scale mining sites was
         not met, with only 73 formalized sites, not reaching the +400 target outlined in the IVA report. (Not
         Achieved).

PDO6: Increased Requests for Mining Exploration Permits: The project aimed to increase the number of
mining exploration permit requests. The baseline was 59, and the project successfully surpassed the target
(of 139) with 143 actual requests. This achievement indicated increased interest and engagement in the
country's mining sector. (High).

PDO 7: Increased Artisanal Miners Under Valid Mining Permit and Trained on Environmental and
Social Good Practices: The project intended to involve artisanal miners (end target 5,000 from a baseline of
0), especially women (end target: 2,000 women), in formalized mining activities. However, this objective was
not met due to activities not commencing at the time of project closure. The number of artisanal miners
operating under a valid mining permit and trained in environmental and social good practices remained at 0,
failing to meet the target of 5,000, as activities had not yet started at the time of closing. The absence of

                            progress in this area highlighted the challenges faced in integrating artisanal miners into the formal sector and
                            providing necessary training and permits. (Negligible).

                            PDO 7: Increased number of women artisanal minder under a valid mining permit: The number of
                            artisanal miners operating under a valid mining permit and trained in environmental and social good practices,
                            of which women, remained at 0 for both baseline and actual counts. The target of involving 2,000 women in
                            these activities was not met, as activities had not yet started at the time of closing. (Negligible).

                            In summary, at project closure, only one of the two PDO indicators related to Objective 2 was achieved. As
                            stated, the number of requests for mining exploration permits (PDO 6) increased from 59 at baseline in 2019
                            to 143 by 2022, surpassing the end-target of 139. This achievement marked a significant step as these
                            permits formalized ASM practices, enhancing their governance. However, the subsequent steps, including the
                            formal issuance of permits (with attention to gender targets) and training on environmental and social good
                            practices (PDO 7), were pending due to delays in procurement and security issues in targeted regions.
                            Furthermore, the nine IRIs associated with Objective 2 were either unmet due to early closure and
                            implementation delays or not reported due to insufficient data.

                            OVERALL EFFICACY
                            Rationale
                            The project's overall efficacy is rated as negligible. Although the project addressed emergency COVID-19
                            needs, establishing a coordination mechanism funded by related PBCs, it only achieved two out of seven
                            PDO indicators (PDOs 1 and 6).

                            However, it is difficult to attribute PDO 1 and PDO 6 to the Bank project. Indeed, even without the project, the
                            Government could have improved access to drinkable water points in targeted regions; and the increased
                            requests for mining exploration permits happened for economic reasons. By 2018, all water points in Niger
                            had been mapped, and their ownership and management had been transferred to LG. (See PAD, p. 77).
                            Therefore, the local authorities were prepared to increase their water points regardless of the project.

                            Regarding PDO 6, Niger is the world’s fourth-largest producer of uranium. Gold, tin, gypsum, coal,
                            phosphates, copper, limestone, and metals are some of the other - less important - mining resources. Niger is
                            also the leading supplier of uranium to the European Union. Over the past ten years, the price of uranium
                            has increased significantly. Following the COVID global recovery and the increase in prices for key
                            commodities, prices rose again starting in 2021 [1]. Even without the Bank project, therefore, it would have
                            been reasonable to expect mining exploration permits to significantly increase given the increase in
                            international uranium prices and the increasing global demand.

 5. Efficiency
Project efficiency is rated negligible due to its brief 18-month implementation period (compared to the planned 5
years) and a low budget execution rate of 26.97 percent. Delays in effectiveness, procurement challenges,
security issues, and political complexities hindered implementation. While mineral exports increased from CFAF
256 billion to CFAF 310 billion, and government revenues rose from CFAF 849 billion in 2019 to CFAF 1,075
billion in 2022, positive trends in government transfers to Local Governments were lacking. The project's impact
on social sectors and peacebuilding could not be adequately assessed due to limited data availability. The
project's closure led to redirected funds totaling US$70 million to address other urgent national development
challenges.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to the limited outcomes achieved is high. While funds associated with two key achievements of the
operation have been disbursed (EUR 3.6 million for the inter-ministerial decision; and EUR 10.8 million for
the COVID-19 emergency response coordination mechanism), the enduring effectiveness and continuity of
these achievements hinge on continued political support, ongoing institutional capacity, and the ability to
navigate evolving circumstances.

The project faced challenges in implementation progress and outcomes. Changes in project circumstances
and the priorities of a new government, along with the evolving political context and increased security
challenges, have made it highly unlikely to secure improvements in Local Governments' capacities,
especially following the July 2023 military coup and the resulting uncertainty around future engagement and
overall reform commitment.

These factors introduce substantial risks that are likely to jeopardize the enduring impact and sustainability of
the achieved outcomes. In particular, the sustainability of achievements related to increased requests for
mining exploration permits is threatened by these factors.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The World Bank's performance at project entry is rated as Unsatisfactory. The project's design was overly
  complex, lacking a strong analytical foundation. It primarily relied on an ambitious 2015 decree that
  bundled activities without sufficient synergies in a fragile and conflict-affected context. The original project
  design provided a TOC, but several PDO indicators were not clearly linked to project activities.

  The project underestimated the capacity gaps at the Local Government (LG) level, impacting LG
  performance. This underestimation stemmed from the absence of in-depth analysis that could have
  provided a comprehensive understanding of the challenges. Additionally, the deadlines set for achieving
  most PBCs were unrealistic.

  In addition, consultations were lacking. Aside from appearing in a footnote, the word “consultations”
  appears only once in the PAD (page 77) in reference to a commitment to include them in supervision.
  Consultations with citizens and direct beneficiaries did not appear to have played any significant role in
  the development of the project. In particular, the Task Team Leader (TTL) highlighted the lack of
  consultations to determine the capacity and needs of local governments.

 Remote supervision did not allow the task team to conduct adequate monitoring, proactive identification of
 bottlenecks or swift remedial actions (ICR notes “the Energy & Extractives co-TTL did not actively take part
 in project supervision and the link between the two project components (focus on decentralization and de-
 concentration on one side and on mining permits and artisanal mining on the other side) was difficult to
 make on the ground.”), (ICR, p. 16).

 The quality of World Bank supervision for the project was heavily affected by COVID-19 travel restrictions.
 Project implementation effectively started during the COVID-19 pandemic; hence the first three supervision
 missions (November 2020, May 2021, and November 2021) were held in virtually. Additionally, the security
 situation in some targeted regions (Agadez, Diffa and Tillabery) prevented the task team from visiting with
 many local beneficiaries due to security threats. This was detrimental to the quality of supervision and did
 not allow the task team to verify implementation and the quality of deliverables on the ground, (ICR, p. 18).

 In the result, the October 2021 restructuring failed to address fundamental issues, such as unrealistic goals
 and inappropriate targets, hindering necessary adaptations in security-affected regions.

 Throughout project implementation, project reporting was regular, but discrepancies in internal
 documentation persisted. ISRs were prepared and filed twice a year but lacked the necessary detail and
 candor (including ratings) to support earlier flagging, and adaptation to emergent contextual, institutional
 and implementation challenges effectively. These challenges were exacerbated by complexities in the
 Results Framework, which were not adequately resolved. Thus, the Results Framework caused
 discrepancies in the formulation and targets of several indicators across the documentation (and across the
 English and French versions of the documentation). The discrepancies in the PAD were carried over into
 all ISRs and added confusion to an already complex M&E system.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The original project design provided a Theory of Change, but several PDO indicators were not clearly
 linked to project activities. It was assumed PBC incentives would prompt ministries of health, education,
 and water to allocate resources to LGs, aiming to enhance service delivery in areas such as the pupils-
 teacher ratio, water point accessibility, and health center access. Consequently, the project design did
 not outline specific activities to directly support improved service delivery in the health, education, and
 water sectors.

 The Results Framework was overly complex, comprising 18 IRIs, 8 PBCs, and 15 PBRs, causing confusion
 and discrepancies across documents. As stated, the Framework caused discrepancies in the formulation

 and in the targets of several indicators across the documentation (and across the English and French
 versions of the documentation.

 The excessive number of indicators, IRIs or PBCs/PBRs rendered the M&E system confusing and
 challenging. Only 2 out of 7 PDO indicators were elevated to PBCs. Furthermore, End targets for
 indicators were poorly set; for example, the pupil/teacher ratio was established at 31.3, deviating from the
 national objective of 45 pupils per teacher (ICR p.8, 16). Moreover, unrealistic targets, such as increasing
 LG annual spending by 200 percent, were deemed unachievable. These issues hampered the project's
 ability to monitor progress accurately and adapt to emerging challenges, leading to unsatisfactory
 outcomes (ICR p. 15).



b. M&E Implementation
  The project faced challenges in M&E due to incomplete data collection. A consultant was hired to assist
  the PIU in creating an M&E manual. Data was gathered from focal points in beneficiary institutions, but
  several indicators remained uncollected at closure (e.g., data concerning geographical coverage of
  geological knowledge (IRI 2.1) or data concerning the adoption of the local content strategy for
  extractives (IRI 2.3)), (ICR p. 17).

  An M&E software (Système d’information pour le suivi-évaluation - SISE) was in development, with a
  beta version provided to the PIU. However, it was still being tested and populated with data at the time of
  project closure, with full functionality anticipated only by mid-2023, shortly before the original closing date.
  These challenges affected the project's ability to comprehensively track its progress and outcomes.



c. M&E Utilization
  The project's updated M&E data, served as the basis for discussions during the MTR but was
  underutilized in alerting course correction and for decision-making (ICR p. 17). While the M&E
  framework informed the mid-term evaluation report prepared by the GoN and the MTR conducted in
  November 2022, the alert regarding inappropriate PDO level targets was not taken into consideration
  during the October 2021 project restructuring (ICR p. 17). The collected M&E data was used for
  mandatory project reports, it was not employed for any other purpose or decision-making processes.

   The project lacked proper Environmental and Social (E&S) safeguards at closure, particularly concerning
   the Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts, including the Gender-
   Based Violence (GBV) Action Plan. Delays occurred in implementing key aspects of the Environmental and
   Social Commitment Plan (ESCP), leading to a lack of activities with E&S impact. The Grievance Redress
   Mechanism (GRM) was also non-operational, as the draft manual was not approved, and no project
   complaints were received due to a lack of accessible and well-publicized GRM. These issues indicate a
   failure to comply with essential environmental and social standards.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Throughout the project implementation, financial management compliance was generally satisfactory. The
   World Bank fiduciary team commended the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for timely submissions of
   essential documents such as the Annual Work Plan (AWP) for World Bank approval; the recruitment of
   independent verification and audit firms; and the timely submission of Interim Financial Reports (IFRs)
   meeting World Bank standards. (ICR, p. 18). However, there were concerns about poor implementation of
   the 2022 AWP, lack of an annual internal audit plan, and absence of an action plan for Payment by Results
   (PBC) verification and payment, indicating room for improvement in financial oversight.

   In terms of procurement compliance, the project started with a satisfactory rating but was later downgraded
   to moderately satisfactory due to delays that led to unmet effectiveness conditions. Despite some
   progress, ongoing significant procurement delays impacted project outcomes. Additionally, irregularities in
   contract management were noted, although the PIU took corrective measures with support from the World
   Bank before the project's closure.

d. Other
   The project was not gender-tagged at appraisal but included a gender focus with one gender disaggregated
   PDO indicator and three disaggregated IRIs. However, the project did not make progress on these
   indicators, indicating minimal impact on reducing gender inequalities in Niger. As a result, the project's
   contribution to gender equality and empowerment was limited, with no significant improvements observed in
   the specified areas.

12. Lessons

The IEG concurs with the lessons set out in the ICR and highlights the following:

      Insufficient Analytical Foundation: The project suffered due to a lack of robust analytical
         underpinning during its design phase. This absence meant that critical assumptions,
         essential for the project's success, were not thoroughly evaluated. This oversight led to an
         inherent optimism bias, where the project's targets were set unrealistically high without a
         proper understanding of the challenges involved.
        Neglect of Niger's Context: The project failed to account for fragile nature of the targeted
         areas, the country's economic constraints (fiscal realities), and the weak implementation
         structures. Ignoring these factors meant that the project was ill-equipped to handle the
         unique challenges posed by the local context.
        Lack of Implementation Capacity: The project did not adequately consider the
         implementation capacity within Niger. This lack of capacity, both in terms of human
         resources and infrastructure, hindered effective budget execution and the delivery of
         essential services at the local government (LG) level.
        Failure to Learn from Similar Projects: Despite similar projects addressing comparable
         issues in neighboring countries like Burkina Faso and Mali, the Niger GOLD project did not
         leverage the experiences and lessons from these initiatives. This lack of comparative
         analysis meant that the project missed out on valuable insights that could have guided its
         design and implementation strategies.
        Overlooking Fiscal Decentralization Patterns: The project set an ambitious target of
         transferring 15 percent of mining revenues from the central government to local
         governments. However, this goal overlooked the historical patterns of fiscal decentralization
         in the region. None of the countries had achieved such a transfer, indicating that the project's
         objective was not grounded in the practical realities of the sub-region.
        Missing Incremental Approach: Successful projects in the sub-region had adopted an
         incremental approach, combining limited but steadily growing fiscal decentralization with
         measures to build confidence and support local government capacity. The Niger GOLD
         project did not follow this proven method, which had shown effectiveness in similar contexts.

The IEG adds the following:

      The importance of utilizing M&E data for informed decision-making. Although the
         project had M&E mechanisms in place, the data generated was not effectively leveraged to
         adjust the project's course or make strategic decisions. This oversight resulted in missed
         opportunities for timely corrective actions, leading to inefficient resource allocation and


                                                                                                      Page 17 of 18

       GOLD & COVID-19 response (P164271)



         potentially hindering the project's overall impact. M&E data should not be viewed merely as a
         reporting requirement but as a tool for project management. Integrating M&E findings into
         decision-making processes can significantly enhance a project's effectiveness and increase
         its chances of achieving desired results.
        The importance of conducting consultations with stakeholders, citizens and direct
         beneficiaries of a proposed project. Consultations with citizens and direct beneficiaries
         were lacking. Their participation in the project will help identify its risks, as well as build trust
         among the people who will be affected by it.

In conclusion, the failure of the Niger GOLD project stemmed from a lack of in-depth analysis,
ignorance of the local context, failure to learn from neighboring initiatives, unrealistic target setting,
and a disregard for established best practices in fiscal decentralization. Future projects must
address these shortcomings by conducting thorough assessments, contextual analyses, and
learning from past experiences to ensure their effectiveness and sustainability.
