d. Components
   1. Original components

   Component 1 Road Rehabilitation and Safety Improvement (cost at appraisal: US$436.7 million;
   actual cost: US$321.2 million) was to continue financing the improvements of 100 km of the main road
   between Ukraine’s two largest cities, Kiev and Kharkiv (the section from Poltava to Valki), to a motorway
   standard (category 1, a four-lane highway with high safety specifications). The road would then be
   integrated with the EU’s extended Trans-European Transport Network. Financing would also cover
   improvements or construction of bridges, interchanges, and bypasses; as well as the supervision of civil
   works, equipment, land acquisition, and resettlement.

   Component 2 Maintenance of Core National Road Corridors (cost at appraisal: US$102.3 million;
   actual cost: US$0.84 million) was to finance maintenance of 840 km of the most strategic road network in
   the country, including core corridors M-06, M-07, and M-03, bridges, interchanges, and bypasses,
   improvements for road safety, and design and site supervision of civil works.

   Component 3 Network Management and Development (cost at appraisal: US$19.6 million; actual
   cost: US$14.3 million) was to support road management reforms in three areas: (i) Road Safety and
   Network Management (including systems for tolling and axle load control, speed cameras, and support to
   stakeholder coordination and an integrated approach to road safety); (ii) Maintenance Management
   (including data collection, planning, design, safety audits, and capacity building); (iii) Preparation of
   Feasibility Studies and Design (including feasibility studies, detailed design, bidding documents, and social
   and environmental safeguards documents). This component also funded the activities of the Project

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 25

2. Changes in components and indicators during implementation

Change in components:

- The first restructuring (January 2017) involved a reduction of the Project scope: it included a cancellation
of loan proceeds in the amount of US$222.2 million and several activities, including the construction of three
bypasses under Component 1 and the maintenance of two road corridors (M-03 and M-07) under
Component 2, as well as respective consultancy services.

- The second restructuring (November 2019) involved a change in components without a modification of the
Project scope; the total Project cost remained unchanged, but there was a re-allocation across components
related to the following:

(i) Adding two activities to Component 1: construction works on a 46.9 km stretch of a main corridor and
road safety works on a 40.8 km stretch of another main corridor. Related costs were covered by a transfer
of US$71.1 million: US$65.9 million from Component 2 and US$5.3 million from Component 3. Component
1 total cost increased to US$321.2 million.

(ii) A cancellation of some of the maintenance activities under Component 2 and a related transfer of
US$65.9 million to Component 1.

(iii) A modification of some of the Component 3 activities, allowing for a transfer of US$5.3 to Component 1.

Change in indicators:

- PDO indicators: the changes in the PDO indicators reflected the changes in components:

(i) At the first restructuring (January 2017), PDO indicator 3 (measuring the outcomes of Component 2
activities) was modified from “Condition in IRI of M-03, M-06 and M-07 corridor sustained at IRI <2.
(Yes/No)” to “Condition in IRI of M-6 corridor sustained at IRI <2. (Yes/No)”, to reflect the cancellation of
maintenance activities on corridors M-3 and M-7 under Component 2.

Note: IRI stands for International Roughness Index. This indicator measured road surface roughness of the
three main corridors to be maintained under the Project. The corridors were in good or fair condition at
appraisal, and the objective was to sustain their condition at a level of IRI<2.

(ii) At the second restructuring (November 2019), PDO indicator 3 “Condition in IRI of M-6 corridor
sustained at IRI <2. (Yes/No)” was dropped, and as a result, the outcomes of Component 2 were no longer
measured.

(iii) At the second restructuring, the following PDO indicator was added: “Fatalities on Poltava-Kharkiv road
(Number)”, to provide more specific data in addition to the original PDO Indicator “Reduction in traffic
accidents involving injury and fatalities on Poltava to Kharkiv road (Number)”.

(iv) At the second restructuring, PDO indicator 4 “Percentage reduction in accidents caused by over-
speeding” was replaced by a former intermediate indicator “Strategy for Maintenance Reform prepared and

                                                                                                    Page 3 of 25

  adopted (Yes/No)”. This meant a reduction in Project’s ambition because the original indicator was
  measuring an intended Project outcome while the new one was measuring an output.

  - Intermediate results indicators: at the second restructuring (November 2019), three intermediate results
  indicators were dropped and one added, with no reduction in scope or ambition compared to the PDO
  indicator changes:

  (i) At the first restructuring, the targets for the following five intermediate results indicators were reduced, in
  correspondence with the reduction in the scope of the related activities: “Total kilometers of road
  constructed on M-03” from 100 kilometers to 66 kilometers; “Length of road maintained using long term
  performance based contracts” from 838 kilometers to 424 kilometers; “Number of direct beneficiaries” from
  43,600 people to 27,100 people; “Number of short term construction jobs created” from 2,000 jobs to 1,200
  jobs; and “Number of long term maintenance jobs created” from 1,600 jobs to 800 jobs.

  (i) At the second restructuring, the following four indicators were dropped: “Roads maintained using long
  term performance-based contracts (number)”; “National system of automatic speed enforcement (Yes/No)”;
  and the two indicators measuring the creation of construction and maintenance jobs by the Project.

  (ii) At the second restructuring, the following two indicators were added: “Roads rehabilitated with improved
  road safety (M-12) (km)”; and “Output-and-Performance-Based-Road-Contracts (OPRC) template bidding
  documents prepared”.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  Project Cost: The appraisal estimate was US$560.0 million, and the actual disbursement was US$337.8
  million. The disbursement included the cost of Project components (US$558.6 million at appraisal and
  US$336.4 million at closure) and the front-end fee of US$1.4 million.

  Project Financing: The Project was financed by an IBRD loan.

  Borrower/Recipient contribution: There was no Borrower’s contribution.

  Project Dates: The Project was approved on November 3, 2015 and became effective on February 11,
  2016. The MTR review was on September 9, 2019. The Project was restructured three times: (i) on January
  17, 2017; (ii) on November 1, 2019; and (iii) on December 21, 2021. The original closing date was
  December 31, 2021. The Project was extended once, during the third restructuring, by nine months, to
  September 30, 2022. The Project’s actual closure was on September 30, 2022.

  Impact of the Russia invasion of Ukraine. At the time of the invasion on February 24, 2022, the Project
  was only seven months away from its revised closing date, the implementation of its activities was
  advanced, and more than 84 percent of the funds was disbursed. The ICR reported that the Project had to
  suspend its Component 1 works at the start of the war, but in late March and April 2022, the security
  situation in the Project areas improved [as the military action was re-focused on other areas of the country],
  and the Project activities were resumed. At Project closing, all civil works were completed and paid, and
  there was no reported direct impact on the rehabilitated assets. (ICR, page 17).

   Reduction of the Project scope and ambition and split evaluation. The Project’s scope was significantly
   reduced with the cancellation of several activities at the first restructuring (January 2017), while its ambition
   was decreased due to a change in its indicators at the second restructuring (November 2019). Therefore,
   efficacy will be evaluated separately for the Original Project, for the first revision, and for the second
   revision.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Country and Sector Context. At the Project’s approval, Ukraine was facing a military conflict in the East,
and political and economic challenges. The country was dealing with Russia’s aggression towards Eastern
Ukraine in 2014, where over five million people were affected; it was also affected by an economic
recession combined with high level inflation, currency depreciation, a banking system crisis, and a large
budget deficit and increasing public debt. In 2014, the gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 6.8
percent, the currency depreciated by 50 percent, and the consumer price inflation was 24.9 percent.
Transportation is critical for the Ukrainian economy: its share in GDP is 11 percent, significantly above the
European average, a high level due to the country’s reliance on agricultural and heavy industry exports.
Ukraine’s economic revival depended on a high-quality transportation system as the backbone of the
economy.

Relevance to Government Strategies at approval. The Project was aligned with the Ukraine’s 2020
Strategy for Sustainable Development; Ukraine’s Transport Sector Strategy; and the Association
Agreement with the European Union (EU). Ukraine 2020 Strategy for Sustainable Development
emphasized the importance of investing in transport networks through two strategic priorities: Reform
Program 9 “Reform of transport infrastructure” and Reform Program 11 “Program participation in trans-
European networks”. The 2016 Updated National Transport Strategy of Ukraine underlined the critical
importance of transport infrastructure rehabilitation and transport sector institutional improvements in the
top two of its seven Priority Axes (pillars): (i) Priority Axis 1 Efficiency In Public Governance in the Transport
Sector, focused on enhancing the policy making of the Infrastructure Ministry and non-biased regulatory
role of the state agencies; and (ii) Priority Axis 2 Provide Quality and Efficient Transport Services, focused
on eliminating barriers to improving the network of national transit corridors and integrating into Trans-
European Transport Network and improving terms of transit corridors. The Association Agreement with the
EU underlined the importance of transport sector development and emphasized the objective of transport
sector restructuring and modernization.

At the time of Project approval, Ukraine had seven major transport corridors supporting transit freight and
serving key economic development objectives. Investments in the east-west corridor (from Kyiv to the
border with Poland) were provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The Project supported the improvement of two other corridors:
the west-east one (from Kyiv to Kharkiv); and the one going east-west first and then turning south (from
Stryi to Znamianka).

Relevance to the World Bank Group's (WBG’s) Assistance Strategies at approval and during
implementation. The Project was aligned with Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2012-2016,
specifically, with Outcome 16: “Improved road connectivity and safety”, which stated that “the Bank will

                                                                                                       Page 5 of 25

                                      Road Sector Development Project (P149322)



               continue to support connectivity to key markets through investments in the modernization of road networks
               and improving road safety” and mentions the intention to initiate “additional road modernization projects” if
               requested. The Project was also aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY2017-2021
               which emphasized the importance of improving “the quality of infrastructure services, particularly in energy
               and transport” by placing it as the first objective under Focus area 1. The CPF stated that competitiveness
               of the Ukrainian economy depended on the transport sector, particularly on a well-functioning transport
               network, a conducive regulatory environment, and on transport and logistics operators. It also stated that
               the road network was deteriorated, requiring urgent maintenance in parallel with constructing new corridors.
               Note: the CPF FY2022-26 was under preparation at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

               Related World Bank operations. The Project continued the World Bank’s support to improving the
               transportation system in Ukraine and was designed to continue the investments made through the following
               operations: Roads and Safety Improvement Project (P100580) and Roads and Safety Improvement Project
               II (P127156). Both projects had facilitated the start of the reform in the transport sector and aimed to
               improve the conditions of the main road corridors and increase traffic safety.

               The overall relevance of the PDOs is High because it was fully aligned with the CPS 2012-2016 and CPF
               2017-2021 (with regard to the latter’s first objective under Focus Area 1 to improve the quality of transport
               infrastructure services, particularly in energy and transport), as well as with the country’s transport sector
               strategy and the Association Agreement with the EU. The PDO, with its focus on improved transport
               connectivity, safety, maintenance operations, and road network management, was also pitched at the right
               level of ambition.

                             Objective
                             PDO1: To improve transport connectivity on selected sections of the national roads network.

                             Rationale
                             The theory of change (ToC) for the Project was not included in the PAD but was developed for the ICR. It
                             showed a direct, logical causal link from inputs (activities) to outputs, and to the PDO outcomes of the Project.
                             There were three results chains. The first results chain showed that the rehabilitation of roads, supported by
                             safety improvements, would produce the outputs of an upgraded main road corridor and stricter speed
                             enforcement in the corridor, ultimately resulting in the achievement of PDO1: improved transport connectivity
                             and road safety. The second results chain demonstrated that the task of maintaining core road corridors
                             would be accomplished as planned (“roads maintained using long-term performance contracts”), ultimately
                             resulting in the achievement of PDO2: improved maintenance operations. The third results chain exhibited
                             that the implementation of the four activities under the Network Management and Development component of

                                                                                                                                Page 6 of 25

the Project would lead to the following outputs: weight-in-motion and automatic speed enforcement systems
implemented; tolling strategy and strategy for maintenance reforms implemented; digital passport
implemented; and feasibility studies and design completed. This would ultimately lead to the achievement of
PDO3: improved road network management.

The ToC is logical, covers all main inputs and outputs, as well as the PDO outcomes; it also shows the main
links from inputs to outputs, and to the PDO outcomes, thus presenting the logic of the Project. The critical
assumptions are also listed. However, the ToC has two shortcomings. First, the intermediate outcomes are
missing, making it hard to understand how the delivered outputs will amount to the achievement of the PDO
outcomes, what are the cause-effect relationships between the outputs and intermediate results and between
the intermediate results and PDO outcomes. This obscures the logic of the Project. Second, the ToC is built
on the basis of the RF and simply replicates the RF intermediate indicators’ targets in the “Output” column.
While this resembles the intended Project outputs, they should not be expressed as the RF targets, but rather
as produced results (e.g., “road upgraded to category 1a” rather than “100 km of the M-03 road upgraded to a
four-lane motorway category “1a”).

Outcomes:

The improvement of transport connectivity and safety in the Project corridors was measured by the Original
Project using the following outcome indicators:

- “Reduction in [average] travel time between Poltava and Valky (minutes)”. The achievement at closure was
110 minutes, against the original target of 96 and the baseline of 140. The target was almost fully achieved.

Note: In the PAD’s RF, this indicator is titled “Reduction in [average] travel time between Poltava and Kharkiv”
(Valky is in-between Poltava and Kharkiv), but the component description in the PAD stated that the activities
would be implemented between Poltava and Valky; therefore, the RF title contains a typo.

Outputs:

The improvement of transport connectivity in the Project corridors was measured by the Original Project using
the following output indicators:

- “Roads constructed, non-rural (M-03) (Kilometers)”. The achievement at closure was 115.52 kilometers of
rehabilitated sections of the M-03 corridor (widening 100.22 kilometers and capital repairs of 15.3 kilometers),
against the original target of 100 kilometers (PAD, page 24) and the baseline of zero. The target was
exceeded.

- “Direct daily road-user beneficiaries (Number)”. The achievement at closure was 20,000 people, against the
original target of 40,000 people. The target was partially achieved.

- “Indirect road-user beneficiaries in Poltava and Kharkiv regions (Number)”. The achievement at closure was
4,400,000, reaching the original target. The target was achieved.

Rating. The Original Project almost fully achieved its intended Objective 1 results, and its efficacy rating is
Substantial.

5. Efficiency
Economic analysis

At appraisal, economic analysis was conducted for Component 1 and Component 2. For Component 1, road
rehabilitation and safety improvements of the M-03 highway between Poltava and Valky were estimated, using a
discount rate of 12 percent over 23 years (PAD, page 34). The economic analysis was conducted using the
Highway Development and Management Tool (HDM-4), which simulates life-cycle predictions of road
deterioration, road works effects and their costs, road user costs, and CO2 emissions. The economic internal
rate of return (EIRR) turned out to be 15.8 percent, the net present value (NPV) was US$113.8 million, and the
cost-benefit ratio was 1.4. The estimated EIRR for Component 1 was above the opportunity cost of capital
reflected in the discount rate of 12 percent, making the Project efficient. The sensitivity analysis showed that
construction costs would need to increase by 39 percent for the Project EIRR to be reduced to the level of
discount rate. For Component 2, detailed data on traffic and road work requirements of the corridors were not
yet available, and therefore, a simplified representative economic evaluation was done, based on aggregate
data and capturing only the benefits of the expected periodic maintenance works. All the main corridors to be
included in the Project activities were evaluated. The EIRR for Component 2 was 50 percent, significantly above
the discount rate of 12 percent, making the Project highly efficient. The NPV was US$610.4 million. (PAD, pages
52-58)

At closure, economic analysis was produced for the road sections within the M-03 corridor between Poltava
and Valky, which were rehabilitated by the Project. These sections were also covered by the appraisal level
economic analysis, but the latter analysis included two more sections, for which the rehabilitation was later
cancelled (therefore, they were not covered by the ex-post analysis). The ex-post economic analysis replicated
the ex-ante analysis using actual investment costs and revised traffic estimates. The EIRR was 18.4 percent
and the NPV is US$88.9 million, indicating that the Project had robust economic justification. (ICR, page 47-48)

Administrative efficiency

The Project’s administrative efficiency had significant deficiencies. The Project was restructured three times, and
the first two restructurings involved reduced scope and ambition, which was needed because Project
implementation had been proceeding slower than planned, and it became clear that the Project would not be
able to accomplish the planned activities on time. At the first restructuring of January 2017, US$222.2 million, or
39.7 percent of the original loan amount, were cancelled. At the second restructuring of November 2019, several
RF indicators were amended, reducing the Project’s ambition. Also, during the third restructuring of December,
2021, the Project’s closing date was extended by seven months, from December 31, 2021 to September 30,
2022.

The Project’s efficiency is rated as Modest, mainly due to the deficiencies of the administrative efficiency.

were as follows: US$1.94 million or 0.57 percent of the Project costs at closure. The disbursed funds before the
second restructuring of November 2019 were US$38.96 million or 11.5 percent of the Project costs at closure.
The remaining disbursed funds constituted US$296.9 or 87.9 percent of the Project costs at closure.
Considering disbursed funds at restructurings as a percentage of total disbursement at closure, the Overall
Project Outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory: (0.0057*3)+(0.115*3)+(0.879*4) = 3.88, which rounds up to
4.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Military conflict. The ongoing war that was inflicted by Russia on Ukraine on February 24, 2022 creates a
high risk of the sustainability of road investments made by the Project. First, the Project area is not far from
the war zone and can be affected by military operations in the near future. Second, the security situation will
likely negatively affect the utilization of the built road corridors and their inclusion in the EU network. Third,
the country dedicates its resources to defense as a priority, and the road sector needs, including the
maintenance of the road assets, while still being important in the war context, falls down the priority list.

Economic. The two restructurings involved the dropping of the road maintenance work. However, without
proper maintenance, road conditions can expect to eventually deteriorate. Given the strategic and economic
importance of the road corridors under the Project, the risk of its deterioration due to potentially insufficient
maintenance can have a negative impact beyond the road sector and affect other economic sectors. (based
on ICR, page 13)

Institutional. As a result of the war, the staff of Ukravtodor (the Ukrainian Roads Agency) has already been
reduced from 60 people to 5 people, jeopardizing the possibility of a sound management of the assets. This
increases the risk that the development outcomes achieved at completion will not be sustained (based on
ICR, page 32).




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The ICR reported that the preparation time of 16 months from initiation to approval was too short
  considering the size of the operation. As a result, Project appraisal did not include important preparatory
  technical and financial studies, which would have facilitated the costing of land acquisition for by-passes
  (the latter had to be cancelled because of the land cost) and would have allowed the first year of
  implementation and supervision through regular follow ups. Eventually, it became clear that the activities
  could not be completed without the studies being redone, the costs clarified, and the issue of the
  absence of advanced procurement resolved. The deficiency of the cost analysis, exacerbated by high
  inflation, was a factor in the cancellation of many activities and slow disbursements. In addition, the
  appraisal did not involve an assessment of the capacity of the Government entities, which led to several

                                                                                                       Page 19 of 25

  issues later; using more technically competent PIUs and the right implementing agencies with a proven
  track record, would have allowed for a better design, which was important considering the ambition of the
  operation. (ICR, pages 30-31)



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Unsatisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 The ICR reported that supervision was effective. Two supervision missions were carried out each year, on
 average. The Aide Memoires and ISRs presented recommendations for improving implementation. The
 involvement of the Kiev-based staff ensured continuity and facilitated a dialogue with local authorities and
 the PIU. During the COVID-19 crisis, an innovative method of “contactless” field visits was used: small
 teams of World Bank specialists would visit the Project corridor, conduct drone overflights, and review the
 footage over videoconferences with the PIU. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, field supervision was
 maintained through a locally based engineering specialist who was able to visit worksites while following
 security requirements.

 The implementation was very efficient in correcting the gaps in Project design. The World Bank's team
 recognized issues early, responded timely, and restructured the Project quickly and effectively when
 needed. For example, the Project placed a sufficient emphasis on the critical issues of financing
 maintenance and reforming the maintenance industry, however, when the market did not respond, the road
 maintenance work was dropped. The World Bank team was able to see the Project in the context of the
 transport sector overall, which supported the second restructuring, enabling synergy with the Ukraine’s
 Roads and Safety Improvement Project II (P127156), which allowed to complete both projects by the
 closing dates, as well as to rebalance financing across the two operations to maximize the level and quality
 of the outcomes. While corrective actions were timely and effective, they were not always reflected properly
 in the RF. (ICR, page 31-32)

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The original RF reflected the logic of Project interventions in the PAD and was sufficiently linked to the
 PDO and to the ToC. Most of the RF indicators were quantitative, and all of them were time-bound, had
 baselines and targets, and were attributable to the Project. The RF was disaggregated by gender. There
 were both PDO outcome and intermediate results indicators to measure each of the objectives; and the

                                                                                                   Page 20 of 25

     Road Sector Development Project (P149322)



 intermediate result indicators were linked to the respective PDO indicators. The indicators measuring
 institutional outcomes were comprehensive and technical. In addition to technical transport sector
 indicators, there were the cross-cutting ones, measuring the number of direct and indirect beneficiaries and
 beneficiary satisfaction with Project results.

 However, as the ICR noted, a simplified M&E framework would have supported data collection better,
 considering difficult implementation conditions and capacity limitations. Also, the PDO indicators could
 have included the assessment of transport costs, trade volume, and passenger travel to better reflect the
 Project outcomes. (ICR, page 27)



b. M&E Implementation
  The ICR reported that the RF was regularly updated by the PIU and reported by the World Bank’s team in
  the Implementation Supervision and Results reports (ISRs). Data to monitor Project performance and the
  achievement of Project results were mostly collected by the World Bank's team during the supervision
  missions.

  However, there were some deficiencies in the M&E implementation. The RF indicators measuring the
  progress of civil works under Component 1 (those related to road safety, travel time, and length of roads
  rehabilitated) were updated in the RF only at the end of the Project, and their reporting in the ISRs was
  not complete. Additionally, while maintenance activities under Component 2 were largely dropped at the
  first and then second restructurings, and the related indicators were removed from the RF, the objective
  of improved road maintenance remained in the PDO, reducing the strength of the links between the RF
  and the ToC/PDO. This deficiency was minor since several maintenance activities remained under
  Component 3 (passportization, strategies, and pilot installations to control heavy vehicles), and therefore
  the maintenance objective of the PDO was supported by the related results. (ICR, page 27)



c. M&E Utilization
  The ICR reported that the World Bank’s team monitored implementation using both the RF and regular
  communication channels with the Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI), the implementing agency, and the PIU.
  This level of supervision allowed the team to provide the Borrower with Project management advice and
  inform the preparation of restructurings.

  However, the outcome indicators had some limitations: while they were useful for the general
  supervision by the World Bank, they provided limited support to the monitoring of infrastructure
  investments, and the lack of data consolidation limited their usefulness for decision making at the
  national level. Also, apart from Project performance indicators, M&E could have provided better support
  to such aspect of performance as the deadlines and the counterpart funding shortfall. (ICR, page 27-28)

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   Environmental and Social Safeguards. At appraisal, the Project was classified as Environmental
   Category B. Potential environmental impact was related to road rehabilitation/repairs. An Environmental and
   Social Management Framework (ESMF), Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and site specific
   Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), with associated Environmental and Social
   Management Plans (ESMPs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), were prepared. Institutional
   arrangements were put in place: Ukravtodor engaged full-time Environmental and Social Safeguards
   Specialists who worked in close collaboration with the road design institute, local authorities, and the Road
   Services in the Project areas. Both contractors and supervision engineers had dedicated environmental
   staff to oversee the implementation of approved ESMPs. The implementing agency established a Grievance
   Redress Mechanism (GRM) in accordance with Bank's recommendations. The grievance log was kept
   updated and was submitted quarterly. A GRM indicator (“Ukravtodor publishes annual report on grievance
   redress management and how issues were resolved”) was included in the RF. Project's performance at
   closing on environmental safeguards was Moderately Satisfactory. (ICR, page 28)

   The Project developed a Safeguards Corrective Action Plan (SCAP) in response to fatal crashes observed
   on road sections under the Project's Traffic Management Plans. The implementation of agreed actions was
   the responsibility of the contractors. The validation of the agreed SCAP actions was the responsibility of
   supervision engineers assigned to each contract.

   To mitigate security concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the PIU (with support
   from the World Bank’s specialists) developed an Occupation Health and Safety Plan, which was
   incorporated into the ESMP following the World Bank’s no-objection. A shelter was constructed close to the
   housing for workers and the office and inspected by representatives of the regional military administration. A
   designated coordinator in place was appointed for each on-site team or in the contractor’s camp, monitoring
   air alarms of the Ukraine’s National Warning System. The State Emergency Service provided medical
   emergency training to the contractor and the engineer’s staff. (ICR, page 29)




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Financial management (FM). The ICR reported that during Project implementation, the FM arrangements
   were Satisfactory, including the last FM monitoring conducted remotely in February 2023. The Project
   hired qualified FM staff and submitted interim financial reports and audit reports on time. The interim
   financial reports were acceptable, and the independent auditors issued an unqualified audit report based
   on the 2020 financial statements. The audits of the Project’s financial statements were completed on time
   and accepted by the World Bank. The only exception was the last audit report covering years 2021-2022,
   which was submitted with a delay in October 2023, due to the budgeting limitations caused by the Russia’s
   invasion of Ukraine. The audit of Project transactions that was handled remotely did not reveal any
   deficiencies in the Project records and accounting documentation. (ICR, page 29)

   Procurement. Procurement Capacity and Risk Assessment conducted during Project preparation
   identified the overall procurement risk as Substantial because of the complexity of the procurement
   packages and the use of performance-based contracts, with which the PIU had little experience. During

                                                                                                   Page 22 of 25

   implementation, procurement performance was rated as Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory. However,
   during the second restructuring in 2019, procurement risk was rated as Substantial, mainly due to a failed
   large tender for long term maintenance of M-06 (which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the
   international competitive bidding because the bidders’ offers significantly exceeded the cost estimate) and
   insufficient time to implement a five-year OPRC contract. Several other procurement issues adversely
   affected Project progress and disbursements, including cases of contract terminations, delays under civil
   works contracts, and contract delays due to COVID-19 outbreak. However, by 2021, the Project had made
   progress, and the ISR procurement rating was Moderately Satisfactory at Project closing. Despite the
   COVID-19 impact and the Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, all procurement procedures were completed by
   Project closure. (ICR, page 30)

12. Lessons

The following lessons were derived from the ICR (ICR, pages 32-33):

Ambition requires flexibility. Implementing a transformational and impactful project in a volatile
environment requires a constant dialogue with the Government and innovative solutions to make
timely adjustments to the design of the project, balancing the ambition and the level of risk. The
Project benefited from the support of the World Bank to escalate issues to the highest political level
and to advocate for Project implementation flexibility and adjustments (including restructurings). The
lesson is that whether mistakes are made with project design or external circumstances require
project’s adjustment, active engagement in project adaptation and a flexible approach to
implementation (including restructurings if necessary) can be critical for a project’s satisfactory
outcome.




                                                                                                   Page 23 of 25

       Road Sector Development Project (P149322)



An adequate allocation of World Bank resources and time to meet supervision program
needs is critical. Short preparation timelines negatively affect development outcomes and often
lead to restructurings to correct inadequate design. Supervision of projects with such deficiencies
requires a reinforced monitoring system, through longer and more involved missions and increased
attention to red flags and early warning signs. In such circumstances, it is essential that proper
World Bank supervision budget be allocated to cover related expenses. The Project’s experience
was that it was essential to be able to spend enough time in the field to (i) tailor interventions based
on specific criteria (particularly, costing within the budget); (ii) find key partners for the project, and
(iii) address the cost evaluation difficulties.

Security constraints require innovation in monitoring and supervision, as well as during the
design stage. When supervision is difficult due to security issues, and conducting field visits is not
possible, teams operating in fragile settings could consider: (i) innovations such as the World Bank’s
Geo-Enabling Initiative for Monitoring and Supervision (GEMS) and Third-Party Monitoring Agents
(TPMAs), and (i) integrating remote supervision capacities into the M&E framework.

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR provides extensive technical details to understand the value-added of the activities and the outcomes
of the Project, a good justification of the PDO relevance, comprehensive and well-supported evidence on all
aspects of the Project’s evaluation, and a clear linking of evidence to findings. The ICR is candid and critical of
the Project’s weaknesses, provides high-quality technical analysis, and suggests lessons that are useful for
future lending operations.

However, the ICR has shortcomings regarding the Annex on the Results Framework. The Annex is missing all
indicator targets. However, the information on the project's ambition and revision of the target is presented in
the other parts of the ICR, and therefore, this deficiency is considered to be moderate.
