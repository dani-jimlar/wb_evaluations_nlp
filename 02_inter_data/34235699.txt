 I.       PROGRAM CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

1. Serbia’s efforts to accelerate income convergence with the EU were halted by the pandemic and energy crises.
   Serbia is a middle-income country that aspires to join the EU and reach EU standards of living. Since receiving the
   official candidate status for EU membership in 2012, the country has worked on aligning its legislation with the EU
   acquis and has made efforts to improve its living standards. As a result, before the pandemic set in, GDP growth
   averaged a solid 3.2 percent between 2015 and 2019. At the same time, Serbia embarked on a comprehensive
   fiscal consolidation programme that brough down public debt from 70 percent of GDP in 2015 to 51.9 percent in
   2019. The trend was, however, reversed by the pandemic that induced a recession of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2020.
   The economic contraction would have been more severe had the government not provided significant fiscal
   support 1. But just as Serbia recovered from the recession with strong GDP growth of 7.7 percent in 2021, the
   energy crisis and a severe drought hit in 2022, exposing further vulnerabilities of a highly resource-intensive
   economy to climate shocks.

2. This Implementation and Completion Results (ICR) report assesses the achievement of the Public Sector
   Efficiency and Green Recovery Development Policy Loan (DPL) to Serbia. The DPL had an objective to support the
   Government of Serbia’s efforts to: (i) increase public sector efficiency; and (ii) initiate a green recovery. The DPL
   was in support of the Government of Serbia (GoS)’s ambitious reforms to (i) sustain the gains of a successful fiscal
   consolidation program by reducing further public sector inefficiencies through digitalization and increased
   transparency; and (ii) initiate the green transition by tackling air pollution and creating a legal framework to address
   the climate change challenges that Serbia is facing. The policy reforms were part of the broader government reform
   and EU accession program. Besides providing support to key reforms, the operation was an important financing
   instrument for the GoS to rebuild fiscal buffers and send a signal to the financial markets of their commitment to
   reforms. The operation was approved in April 2021 in the amount of EUR 82.4 million and disbursed in December
   2021.

A. Context at Appraisal

3. Solid macroeconomic fundamentals allowed Serbia to endure the pandemic crisis, but new challenges have since
   emerged. In the years prior to the pandemic, Serbia’s growth averaged 3.2 percent over 2015-19, driven by private
   consumption and investments, whilst net exports provided negative contributions to growth. However, these
   growth rates were insufficient to ensure a rapid convergence to EU income levels. As a result, the government was
   embarking on a diverse set of measures to promote faster growth. During the same period, the GoS implemented
   a comprehensive fiscal consolidation program which curbed mandatory spending and benefited from efficiency
   gains, and improved revenue collection, which resulted in a rapid improvement in the fiscal balance. This was
   reduced from a fiscal deficit of 6.2 percent of GDP in 2014 to the fiscal surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2017 and a
   balanced budget thereafter. Serbia thus entered the pandemic crisis with strong fiscal buffers, which allowed the
   government to provide a timely fiscal support package of 11.6 percent of GDP in 2020 to cushion the negative
   impacts. However, as a result the fiscal deficit swelled to 8 percent of GDP and public debt increased compared to
   the pre-pandemic levels, reaching 57.1 percent of GDP. The government intervention thus largely exhausted
   Serbia’s fiscal buffers, requiring renewed reform actions to resolve fiscal pressures and make the economy more
   resilient to external shocks.

        The measures included a wage subsidy program, debt moratoria, tax payments deferrals, subsidized lending, and the
      issuance of loan guarantees for businesses.

4. The government thus committed to accelerating necessary reforms, including on the green growth agenda. The
   government, which was constituted in October 2020, declared the acceleration of reforms for EU accession and
   boosting resilience of the economy among their top priorities. One of the priorities was to sustain fiscal
   consolidation gains from 2014-19 by containing the public wage bill, increasing efficiency through further
   digitalization of government services, adopting better control and monitoring of the use of public funds and
   increasing transparency. This included measures aimed at resolving issues of poorly targeted social safety net
   spending that became more visible during the pandemic. Furthermore, in November 2020, Serbia signed the Sofia
   Declaration on the Green Agenda for the Western Balkans 2, aligned the country with the EU Green Deal, as the
   government committed to improving energy efficiency, reducing emissions, reducing air pollution 3, increasing the
   share of renewables in its energy mix, minimizing waste, and transitioning to a circular economy. But, considering
   the complexities of the political environment, the government announced its term would be shorter than expected
   as it announced general elections for 2022. For this reason, the government requested a standalone operation.

5. This DPL was strongly anchored in the GoS’s reform agenda and World Bank’s previous operations and analyses.
   The DPL supported policy and institutional changes consistent with the economic program set out in Serbia’s Fiscal
   Strategy for 2021-23, focused on preserving macroeconomic stability to ensure a fast recovery from the pandemic,
   reducing the fiscal deficit to curb public debt, and implementing structural reforms to improve the competitiveness
   of the private sector. These reform priorities were also outlined in Serbia’s Economic Reform Program 2021-23,
   which also included a number of specific reform measures supported by this DPL. Moreover, the DPL contributed
   to World Bank Country Partnership Framework FY2022-26, approved in May 2022, with the goal of supporting
   Serbia’s robust recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 and fostering growth that would be sustainable across
   generations. The DPL also built on the analytical findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic Update 4, the 2020
   Country Economic Memorandum 5 for Serbia and a strong track record of previous successful DPL operations 6.

6. Effective coordination with other development partners resulted in a shared platform for policy dialogue and
   support to Serbia’s ambitious program reform. Considering the importance of public sector reforms and greening
   the recovery for the EU accession process of Serbia, the DPL was closely coordinated with the European Union
   (EU), UNDP, and the IMF. In addition to that, the World Bank partnered with the French Development Agency
   (Agence Française de Développement, AFD) which provided parallel financing of EUR 50 million for the budget
   support and EUR 0.5 million for technical assistance in support of the reform measures under Pillar 2 of the policy
   matrix. This partnership was first of that kind in Serbia and created a platform for subsequent joint operations and
   more coordinated policy dialogue. At the time of the preparation of this DPF, the World Bank also initiated
   discussion with the German Development Bank (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW) to ensure stronger synergies
   in terms of support provided to the GoS.

      policy areas and institutional reforms to enable a more resilient and sustainable economic growth in the aftermath
      of the pandemic crisis which revealed key vulnerabilities. Particularly important was initiating policy reforms in the
      area of climate change and environment protection, which provided a solid foundation for reforms that will be
      implemented after this operation was closed.

      Original Policy Areas/Pillars Supported by the Program (as approved)

8. The overarching objective of this operation is to support GoS’s reform actions for a more resilient economy. It
   was structured around two pillars that aimed to: (i) increase public sector efficiency and transparency, and (ii)
   initiate a green recovery. These reform actions contribute to stability of public finances and broader development
   goals of improving competitiveness and ensuring higher standards of living of Serbian citizens.

9. Pillar 1: Increase Public Sector Efficiency and Transparency. To sustain gains from a comprehensive fiscal
   consolidation program carried out during 2014-18, the government was committed to increase further public
   sector efficiency and transparency, especially in the context of renewed fiscal constraints due to the pandemic. In
   that regard, this operation supported reforms of: (i) simplifying, digitizing, and ensuring access to public
   procurement for all firms through the online portal; (ii) keeping control of total public sector employment (and the
   wage bill) while ensuring full operationality of the government; (iii) ensuring the social assistance are harmonized
   and up-to-date; (iv) improving the control of state aid to contribute to a level playing field for private companies
   compared with SOEs; and (v) facilitating businesses’ access to foreign markets and financing from abroad.

10. Pillar 2: Initiate a Green Recovery. Serbia’s highly carbon-intensive economy has suffered an increasing number
    of adverse environmental effects. Despite a decrease over the past decade, Serbia’s carbon intensity of GDP
    remains almost three times as high as the EU’s, largely driven by its heavy reliance on lignite for thermal power
    generation, the burning of which pollutes the air, resulting in a hazard for public health. The government has
    recognized the significance of the challenge and committed to addressing it. Another important driver of greening
    economic growth is Serbia’s ambition to join the EU, which includes aligning their legislation with EU acquis,
    including on energy, environment, and climate change, which has been at the very top of the EU agenda. In that
    regard, this operation supported: (i) reducing air pollution from sulfur by regulating its maximum content in fuel;
    (ii) reducing air pollution from nitrogen oxide by controlling their emissions from large combustion plants; and (iii)
    adopting a legal and institutional framework to address climate change challenges.

      Significant Changes During Implementation

11. There were no significant changes to the PDO nor to the policy areas during implementation of the DPL.


II.     ASSESSMENT OF KEY PROGRAM DESIGN AND OUTCOMES

12. Most of the targets for the result indicators (RI) have been achieved by December 2022. All but one sub-target
    for the RIs in Pillar 1 have been achieved on time, with four of six exceeding the targeted value, i.e., achieving even
    stronger than expected impact. On the other hand, the targets for the RIs in Pillar 2 have been partially achieved,
    as the target result indicators were found to be difficult to verify as they have been defined as a number that is a
    result of a modelling process, so as an alternative, easier to verify indicators have been used. A summary of the
    achievement status of the DPL result indicators is presented in the table below.

13. All prior actions are strongly linked to the achievement of the PDO, which was highly relevant at appraisal and
    is even more relevant today. The PDO was not too general and appropriately captures the strength of the

    consistent with the country’s strategy as outlined in the Economic Reform Program for 2023-25 11. As regarding the
    consistency with WBG strategy, the PDO was very much relevant with the CPF 2022-26 high-level objectives of

    implementing the EU directives on the selection of economic operators in public procurement procedures. As an
    EU candidate country, Serbia has been aligning its legal framework in this area with the EU acquis. Moreover,
    Serbia’s public procurement market has been increasing over years and stood at 8.9 percent of GDP in 2021, and
    the new Law on Public Procurement provided an improved regulatory system for public procurement and
    mandated all public procurement procedures be completed through the online procurement portal, which reduces
    bureaucracy and administrative costs for both the public and private sectors and ensures higher transparency. The
    proposed PA thus contributed to the achievement of the intended objective.

15. PA#2 aimed to improve public expenditure efficiency through better management of public sector employment,
    and ultimately the control of the wage bill. This PA builds on government’s comprehensive public administration
    reform program 12, which reduced the wage bill as a share of GDP from 11 percent of GDP in 2014 to 9.5 percent
    of GDP in 2019, opening fiscal space for public investment which increased from 2.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 4.9
    percent of GDP in 2020. To sustain these gains, shortly interrupted by the pandemic crisis, the GoS approved the
    Decree on the Procedure for Obtaining Approval for New Recruitment or Additional Temporary Employment with
    Budget Beneficiaries 13, which defines the process of hiring, regulates the role of the Commission for New Hiring,
    and sets the rules related to the transparency of the process. While controlling new employment, the decree also
    introduces a degree of flexibility after the employment freeze policy introduced in 2014. The analytical foundations
    for this PA were credible, including World Bank functional reviews, SIGMA’s 2019 Serbia Monitoring Report, and
    EU report recommendations. The PA made a significant contribution to the achievement of the intended outcome
    and supported the government’s efforts to strengthen public spending efficiency and transparency.

16. PA#3 was important to improve targeting of social assistance, reduce exclusion and inclusions errors, and
    ultimately strengthen the social safety net, while simultaneously increasing public spending efficiency. While
    Serbia’s social spending as percent of GDP declined from 16.7 percent in 2014 to 14.4 percent in 2019, inefficiencies
    and issues of rational and fair distribution remain, and are greatly rooted in the lack of consolidated data on the
    socioeconomic status of existing and prospective beneficiaries. To address this issue, the Government the Law on
    Social Card in 2021, setting the legal basis for the full implementation of the Social Card registry to allow easier
    social screening and faster and more appropriate government support to those in need. This PA supports these
    efforts and is based on a series of analytical reports, including the Systematic Country Diagnostic Update, the World
    Bank’s 2019 report on Strengthening Social Protection for Disaster Response, and others. The PA is thus very
    relevant for the achievement of the objective of this operation to improve public sector efficiency and
    transparency.

17. PA#4 aims to strengthen external scrutiny of public finances by establishing an independent agency for state aid
    control, thus improving the provision and monitoring of state aid and enforcing robustly state aid rules. Serbia’s
    state aid is significant in scale and largely skewed towards SOEs, thus distorting competition, and putting the
    private sector in a disadvantaged position. At the same time, control and monitoring of the state aid has been
    relatively weak. Taking into consideration Serbia’s commitment to aligning its legislation with the EU acquis in the
    framework of EU accession, the GoS adopted the new Law on Sate Aid Control which establishes the Commission
    for State Aid Control, an independent institution, that is tasked with verifying the alignment of the state aid
    provided with the Law on State Aid. The role of the Commission was particularly pronounced during 2020 and 2021

    12 Several measures were adopted in 2014 to contain the public wage bill: a de facto wage cut by 10 percent, a suspension
    of indexing wages to inflation, and a restriction in new hiring.
    13 The expansion of new permanent staff should be no more than 1 percent annually.

    when the government provided a sizable fiscal support, large share of it in the form of state aid, that was reviewed
    for compliance by the Commission. The analytical basis for this reform was adequate because the reform was
    chosen directly from the World Bank 2019 Country Economic Memorandum, guided by the EU accession
    requirement of Serbia, and informed by the EU annual report. Furthermore, the new Public Financial Management
    (PFM) Reform Program covering the period 2021-25 incorporates reforms supported by the first pillar of this
    operation related to more transparent use of public funds and stronger scrutiny. The PA is thus very relevant and
    contributed significantly to the achievement of increased transparency and higher efficiency of public spending.

18. The focus of PA#5 is to improve transparency on the legal framework and practices for international financial
    and capital transactions. Notwithstanding improvements over the past decades, Serbia has a relatively strict
    control over international financial and capital transactions. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) reviews
    documentation and assess its compliance with the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. However, there has been
    ambiguity as the opinions were issued on a case-by-case basis and have not been available to other entities facing
    similar issues. In that regard and informed by the 2019 World Bank Country Memorandum and 2019 USAID report
    on the effect of foreign exchange liberalization, the NBS started publishing a summary of opinions previously issued
    to businesses, banks, and individuals, thus enhancing clarity and certainty for similar financial and capital
    transactions and reducing administrative costs both for the NBS and interested parties. This PA thus contributed
    to increased transparency and predictability, which in turn improves the business environment for both foreign
    investors seeking opportunities in Serbia and Serbian businesses seeking to expand their operations abroad.

19. PA#6 and PA#7 were important reforms to help Serbia initiate actions that will reduce air pollution. Serbia’s air
    pollution has become one of the top public health concerns – with 175 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019, Serbia
    topped a list of death rates from pollution among European countries. Moreover, Serbia’s reliance on domestic
    lignite is the main cause of the high carbon footprint and greatly responsible for the poor air quality. All these risks
    have been recognized by the government, that has put climate change and environmental protection as two of
    their top five priorities. The first two prior actions under this pillar support a reduction in the emissions of pollutants
    from residential heating and large combustion plants. Attribution from the reforms to the PDO was thus clear as
    PA#6 and PA#7 directly address air pollution concerns. However, RI#6 and RI#7 were defined as emission of tons
    of sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide, the baseline and targets are a result of the modelling process and not easily
    verifiable. Moreover, there are limitations in understanding the impact of nitrogen dioxide emissions on air
    pollution concentration, which weakens the results chain.

20. PA#8 was a critical reform, as it sets the legal framework for addressing climate change challenges. Climate
    change is considered an important medium- to long-term challenge by the government, as Serbia is reliant on
    domestic coal for its energy needs and is planning to pursue a “just transition” to cleaner energy sources and to
    reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Serbia is also significantly affected by climate-related extreme weather
    events, that are hurting the economy and households. The government has started by creating the enabling legal
    framework for climate action, and PA#8 supports adoption of the Climate Change Law, that strengthened the
    institutional mechanism for oversight of climate action and provides a basis for the adoption of a low-carbon
    strategy and the climate change adaptation program, in line with the Paris Agreement. The analytical underpinning
    for this PA was credible and based on a series of reports, including World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic
    Update, Serbia’s Nationally Determined Contributions, and other reports. The PA is very relevant and contributed
    significantly to the achievement of the PDO of creating a solid foundation for Serbia’s green transition.

B. Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

21. While all the RIs are relevant with feasible and ambitious targets, two RIs are found to be difficult to measure.
    RI#6 and RI#7 were defined as estimated national emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, and these
    estimates are modelled results which are not easily verifiable. For that reason, this report identifies alternative
    indicators for these two RIs, which are measurable and the data on which is produced and published by the
    Statistical Office of Serbia. Considering these alternative indicators, it is concluded that most RIs were achieved,
    except for RI#8 and one sub-indicator for RI#1. Moreover, three RIs exceeded the targets by a wide margin, as did
    one sub-indicator for RI#1.

22. The impact of PA#1 was measured by two RIs, both of which were relevant and measurable, with ambitious
    targets, of which one exceeded and the other missed the target. One sub-target measured the share of completed
    public procurement transactions in the public sector using the public procurement portal, which became fully
    operational on 1 July 2020, allowing for all stages of public procurement procedure to be completed online. The
    sub-target was surpassed as 98.7 of all completed public procurement transactions in 2022 were conducted using
    the public procurement portal. 14 The second sub-target measuring the average number of bids was missed – the
    average number of bids in 2022 remains 2.5 as in the baseline year. However, it is important to note that the share
    of contracts signed by SMEs in the total number of contracts signed increased from 69 percent in 2020 to 76.1
    percent in 2022.

23. RI#2 measured the share of new hiring in the public sector done under the new procedure, and was relevant,
    measurable, and had an appropriate target. In December 2020, the GoS introduced a new procedure for
    prioritizing and controlling recruitment in the public sector, which extended the employment control introduced
    in 2014, but relaxed the procedure of replacing staff who leave, allowing for 7 new recruits without the
    Commission’s approval for 10 staff who leave. As a result, the share of public sector employment in total
    employment declined from 28.6 percent in 2019 to 27.1 percent in 2022, and the wage bill as percent of GDP
    increased only marginally from 9.5 to 9.8 percent. Moreover, in December 2022, Serbia introduced a new fiscal
    rule which limits the public sector wage bill to 10 percent of GDP, thus further sustaining gains of this reform.

24. RI#3, measuring the share of beneficiaries registered in the Social Card Register, was very relevant, measurable,
    and had an appropriate target, which was surpassed. The social card register, in use since March 2022, has helped
    the government to identify both ‘errors of inclusion’ and ‘errors of exclusion’ in individuals’ eligibility to social
    assistance benefits and has supported more efficient provision of social assistance. The register is fully operational
    and is linked to other government registers for more accurate information on existing and potential beneficiaries.
    There are over 175,000 social assistance beneficiaries registered. The register has consolidated data on
    beneficiaries and has helped resolve some issues of spending inefficiencies15 – e.g., payments to deceased
    beneficiaries, multiple payments to same beneficiaries, or inaccurate information on beneficiaries that has not
    allowed them to exercise the right on social benefits. Moreover, in case of need (e.g., a crisis), the Social Card
    Registry would enable the government to respond immediately and in a targeted manner. RI#3 surpassed its target
    before the end of operation – already in April 2022, 100 percent of social beneficiaries were included in the register.


     14
       The share refers to all public procurement contracts signed through the new portal in 2022. Specifically, as per the Public
     Procurement Office Annual Report for 2022, 3,399 contracts were signed under the former public procurement procedures,
     out of total 251,949 contracts signed in 2022.

25. RI#4, measuring the impact of the institutional reform in the area of state aid, was relevant, measurable, and
    with an appropriate targeted that was surpassed. RI#4 measured the volume of state aid, expressed as percent
    of GDP, that is recorded by the Commission for State Aid Control in a publicly available list of support schemes of
    state aid, which includes information on the amounts, grantors, legal basis, and compliance with the Law on State
    Aid. RI#4 was clearly defined and surpassed its target by the end of operation, as the state aid recorded by the
    Commission for State Aid Control amounted to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2021 16, well above the 1 percent set as the
    target. The baseline was set for 2021, considering the time needed to collect the information on performance, and
    was clearly explained in the Program Document. However, it is worth noting that much higher than expected level
    of state aid was a result of COVID-19 support measures that continued into 2021 and accounted for 28.7 percent
    of total state aid provided in 2021.

26. RI#5 was relevant in measuring the impact of increased transparency of the regulatory framework for
    international financial and capital transactions, and the appropriately set target was exceeded by a wide margin.
    As the National Bank started publishing a summary of opinions 17 issued to businesses, banks, and individuals on its
    website, along with the corresponding legislation, the number of requests for opinions decreased from 164 in 2019
    to 81 18 in 2021, and 74 19 in 2022. The target was thus exceeded by a wide margin, as the baseline set for RI#5 was
    130.

27. RI#6 and RI7 cannot be assessed as they are not readily verifiable, and their baseline and target values are set
    as estimated results of the modelling process that is not explained. RI#6 was originally defined as “estimated
    national emissions of estimated use of heavy fuel oil with 3 percent sulfur content” and the target was set to 0
    tons in 2022. However, as these are modelled results that are not published, these cannot be verified. As a
    substitute, consumption of heavy fuel oil with more than 1 percent sulphur content for energy production20 was
    considered as alternative. Using this alternative measure RI#6 was considered to be partially achieved, as
    consumption of heavy fuel oil with more than 1 percent sulphur content for energy production declined from
    61,899 tonnes in 2020 to 25,727 tonnes in 2021. The target year is considered 2021, since this is the latest available
    data. RI#7 was also defined as “estimated national emissions” of nitrogen oxide from large combustion plants. Just
    like with RI#6, these are modelled estimates that are not published and verifiable. Consequently, an alternative RI
    was used and measured as emissions of nitrogen dioxide from the energy sector. This alternative RI#7 is estimated
    to be partially achieved, as emissions of nitrogen dioxide declined from 73,397 tons in 2020 to 68,438 tons in 2021.

28. RI#8 was defined to measure the pace of implementation of the Climate Change Law, and this RI was
    measurable, relevant, and with an ambitious target that was partially met. RI#8 was clearly defined as the
    number of bylaws, i.e., implementing legislation, that the government adopted since the Law on Climate Change
    entered into force on 31 March 2021. The RI measures the number of pieces of implementing legislation to enable
    implementation of the law and sets the target to six bylaws adopted by end-2022, out of 12 bylaws foreseen for
    the full implementation of the law. RI#8 was thus very specific, measurable, with an ambitious target considering
    how complex and constantly evolving is the legislative framework to tackle climate change issues, the awareness

    of which has increased significantly over the past years. RI#8 fell just short of its target when the operation
    concluded – five bylaws 21 have been adopted compared to the six targeted, and the MoEP is aiming to adopt the
    rulebook enabling the operationalization of a national MRV IT platform as well as the GHG permitting system by
    end-2023. However, Serbia made significant progress by adopting the Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS)
    2023-2030. The LCDS is consistent with the revised Nationally Determined Contribution submitted in August 2022
    by Serbia to the UNFCCC and paves the way for the adoption of Serbia’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP),
    in line with the requirements of the Energy Community. Serbia is simultaneously increasing environmental funding
    and investments and initiating a wide range of activities in greening its economy. This also includes activities linked
    to PA#1 with adopting the guidelines for green procurement and to PA#4 as the government adopted a Decree on
    the conditions and criteria for the compliance of state aid for investment in sectors of importance for reaching a
    zero rate of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also worth noting that the MoEP decided to merge a number of bylaws
    out of the initial 12 bylaws indicatively foreseen at the time of the adoption of the Climate Change Law. The
    rationale for this decision was to streamline the preparation of secondary legislation, following guidance from the
    experts mobilized with support from AFD and the World Bank, in the period following the approval of the DPL. This
    contributed to a global reduction in the number of bylaws necessary to implement the Law, a material change not
    anticipated at the time of defining the RI#8. Considering a wider context, and relevant actions taken besides
    adoption of the Law on Climate Change implementing legislation, this RI was assessed as partially achieved.

C. Overall Outcome Rating and Justification

     Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

29. The overall outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory, considering the relevance of prior actions and efficacy
    of result indicators. Despite not all RIs meeting their targets in 2022 as originally defined in the program document,
    the DPL supported very important reforms for Serbia in a critical time, which resulted in significant progress
    achieved since 2021. The DPL supported well-designed policy reforms, including through public administration and
    public financial management reforms, social security, competitiveness, and environmental and climate change
    reforms, aligning closely with the GoS’s development agenda. All PAs had a strong link to the achievement of the
    PDO, were well defined, based on a solid analytical background, and were mostly informed by a credible results
    chain, despite RI#6 and RI#7 not being verifiable as their values have been selected as a result of a modelling
    process, the data on which is not being disseminated. Nevertheless, this evaluation used the alternative indicators
    that showed there was progress achieved. Overall, all RIs in the first pillar can be assessed as having exceeded the
    targets originally set, with partially achieved RIs for the second pillar.



III. OTHER OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS

A. Poverty, Gender and Social Impacts

30. The reform actions under PA#3 supported by this DPL have indirectly benefited the poor and vulnerable. The
    establishment of the Social Card Registry now covers all social assistance beneficiaries, providing the government
    with more accurate and reliable data on their socioeconomic status. Reliable data is critical for evidence-based
    policymaking and helps the efforts of the government to ensure provision of assistance and support to those in
    need. The registry integrates the data from multiple sources to provide a multi-dimensional view of vulnerability –

     21

                                                                                                               Page 16 of 32

 Public Sector Efficiency and Green Recovery DPL (P164575)



    the registered integrates the data from the competent ministry, but also other registers, including the central
    population register, cadaster, tax, pension insurance, employment, and the Ministry of the Interior registers. This
    data is important to inform policies to support the most vulnerable, while also reducing the “exclusion” 22 and
    “inclusion” 23 errors. Moreover, the data is being updated on a daily basis, making social protection more adaptive
    during crises. Moreover, the existing appeals mechanism for social benefits and the extensive communication
    about the Social Card Registry help cushion against the negative impacts of potential exclusion errors.

31. The reform actions supported under Pillar 2 were correctly assessed as having a mixed impact on poverty. While
    reforms aimed at tacking air pollution challenges were expected to result in better health outcomes for the entire
    population, including the most vulnerable, multiple external shocks reduced the overall impact. This is primarily
    related to the energy crisis that started in early 2022, initiated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that has led to high
    energy and food prices internationally, and consequently an increase in the overall level of prices. While Serbia
    was shielded greatly having the electricity prices regulated and caped, including through expanding the energy
    support program for the most vulnerable (supported by the subsequent World Bank DPL Series 24), the overall
    increase in prices affected poor and vulnerable. However, these risks have been partially mitigated through
    activities undertaken under PA#3 that supported the creation of the social beneficiaries’ register that allows more
    efficient implementation of social protection policies. On the other hand, reform activities supported under PA#8
    were correctly assessed to benefit livelihoods of the entire population in the long term by creating a legal and
    institutional framework to address climate change challenges, that disproportionally affect the most vulnerable.


B. Environmental, Forests, and Natural Resource Aspects

32. This DPL incorporated PAs that have significant positive environmental effects. The entire Pillar 2 is designed in
    such way to support Serbia’s efforts to address significant environmental and climate vulnerabilities, which the
    government also recognised as development priorities for the country. The improved legislative, regulatory and
    institutional framework for environment protection and climate change – supported by PA#6, PA#7, and PA#8
    under Pillar 2 result in reduced air pollution and consequent reduction in emission of GHG, as measured by RIs of
    Pillar 2, including the alternative indicators proposed by this report. Moreover, the adoption and implementation
    of the Law on Climate Change under PA#10 leads to better planning, implementation, and monitoring of climate
    change policies and ultimately leads to better health, economic, and social outcomes. As a result of this reform,
    which provided a legal basis, Serbia adopted its Low Carbon Development Strategy 2023-2030. Moreover, the
    efforts under PA#8 were part of coordinated efforts of Serbia, which resulted in a submission of the updated
    nationally determined contribution to the Paris Agreement, with Serbia committing to a 33.3 percent decrease in
    greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Additionally, the reform under PA#8 came in just
    in time when the EU heavily increased its focus on greening the economy and committed to becoming the world’s
    first climate-neutral continent under the European Green Deal as it set a legally binding target of achieving net-
    zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Having already adopted its legal framework for climate change has put
    Serbia in a much better starting position to tap into increasingly available EU funds.

C. Institutional Change/Strengthening

     22
        For example, through 12,590 notifications on deceased beneficiaries, the social centres are able to react swiftly and stop
     further payments, as there have been more than 5,000 cases identified of continuous payments to deceased people.
     23
        As reported by the Ministry, by July 2023, there were 106,838 cases when beneficiaries were notified that they can exercise
     the right on a certain social benefit, of which they were not aware (e.g., child allowance).

33. The reform measures on creating an independent state aid control mechanism and establishing a legal
    framework on climate change have led to important institutional improvements. All reform measures
    contributed to strengthened institutions, not only through implemented reforms, but also through policy dialogue
    and regular interactions during the DPL preparation through knowledge sharing and technical assistance provided.
    However, this is particularly evident for reform measures supported under PA#4 and PA#8, that set up the
    institutional and legal frameworks for state aid control and climate change, respectively. As a result of reforms
    under PA#4, an independent Commission for State Aid Control was established, and during the preparation of the
    DPF, the Bank provided continuous feedback on both the Law on State Aid and the founding Statute of the
    Commission. Based on solid foundation, the Commission expanded and strengthened its capacity, and as of
    December 2023 has 19 employees and five members of the Council. As a result of reforms under PA#8, a legal
    framework for climate change has been established, providing structure, accountability, and framework for action
    to mitigate climate change and adapt to it through actions to manage risks and build resilience in the face of these
    changes. Also, the legal framework enabled much stronger control mechanisms and oversight of climate actions.
    Moreover, the number of full-time staff placed under the Climate Unit of the MoEP also benefitted from a two-
    fold increase. This signals a structural improvement in the capacity of Serbia to deliver on this agenda, despite
    persisting gaps in human resource capacities to sustain the global requirements of Chapter 27 (Environmental and
    Climate Change) of the EU acquis.

D. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

34. There are no other unintended outcomes or impacts.

IV. BANK PERFORMANCE

     Rating: Satisfactory

35. The design of reforms supported by this operation was based on strong analytical underpinnings. Solid and
    clearly relevant analysis helped build consensus among the government, World Bank, and other development
    partners. These included both government’s strategic documents (e.g., Economic Reform Program, Fiscal Strategy,
    and key sectoral strategies), and World Bank’s key documents (Country Partnership Framework, Country Economic
    Memorandum, Systematic Country Diagnostic Update). Government consultations were held throughout the
    project preparation to agree on and validate the policy reforms supported through the DPL.

36. The DPL provided important financing at a time of crisis when Serbia was in need of external financing,
    leveraging additional parallel resources from AFD. Serbia undertook a significant fiscal response to the COVID-19
    pandemic, helped by the creation of fiscal space in the years before. The DPL played an important role in both
    supporting the rebuilding of fiscal buffers, as well as signaling to markets. In this context, the choice of a standalone
    DPL is considered to be appropriate.

37. The design of this DPL built on the experience of previous World Bank projects and enabled continued policy
    dialogue with the government. Previous operation supported reforms that preceded those supported by this DPL
    (1st and 2nd Public Expenditure and Public Utilities DPLs, the Public Sector PforR on Modernization and
    Optimization of Public Administration). While this has been a standalone operation, the continuity of reform
    commitments and actions translated in de-facto first of a series of three, as the first of two programmatic Serbia

    Green Transition DPF series (P177410) was later approved in 2022, further sustaining the results of a strong reform
    momentum initiated by this operation.

38. Close and continuous communication between the World Bank team and government helped ensure
    government’s commitment to reforms. Maintaining a close dialogue with counterparts was mutually beneficial as
    it resulted in strong working relationships and helped achieve the results as planned. Furthermore, keeping the
    dialogue open helped recognized challenges in implementation and helped resolve this much more efficiently
    through technical assistance that was mobilized much quicker and was more targeted to the client’s needs, with
    shared leverage and technical support efforts with AFD regarding the policy areas targeted under Pillar 2.
    Additionally, close and regular coordination with development partners helped steer the reform process.

39. The result indicators have been defined as best available at a given time, but the issue of measurability and
    verification emerged during the review process. As discussed above, the result indicators for PA6 and PA7 are
    assessed as difficult to measure and verify. However, these indicators were selected at the time of the preparation
    because of a lack of exact data and a time lag of data availability. However, defining the results indicators as
    estimated results of a modelling process created issues with external validation of data and emerged as a lesson
    learnt for future operations (see Section VI).

40. The program document appropriately assessed the perceived risks as moderate and identified relevant
    mitigation measures. The overall risk of the operation was correctly assessed as ‘moderate’, despite the high level
    of global uncertainty when this operation was appraised. The team was not carried by the pessimistic sentiment
    of the time, and rightly recognized some risks that materialized in a year after the operation was approved – an
    increase in interest rates on international financial markets and a slower than expected growth of Serbia’s main
    trading partners. These materialized mostly given a new shock in 2022, that was initiated by Russia’s invasion of
    Ukraine. Nonetheless, the reforms supported by the DPL partially mitigated the risks. The macroeconomic risk
    mitigation was partly captured given the GoS’s timely and strong policy actions to both the pandemic and energy
    crises.

V. RISK TO SUSTAINABILITY OF DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES

41. Program outcomes are likely to be sustained, although there are risks. The operation supported some very
    ambitious reforms, particularly reforms under Pillar 2 that aimed to tackle air pollution and created a legal
    framework on climate change, that require not only strong commitment, but strong capacities to implement and
    sustain these reforms. Consequently, some of these reforms have faced delays and are yet to be completed.
    However, these are mitigated by continued technical and financial support from the World Bank and other
    development partners. As a matter of fact, the World Banks’s subsequent first in a series of two DPL programmatic
    operation (P177410) builds on the reform momentum captured by this operation. Furthermore, the engagement
    from this operation resulted in more analytical work of the Bank to inform the government decision making, such
    as the World Bank report ‘Supporting Serbia’s Transition to Greener and More Resilient Growth: Policy and
    Institutional Reforms’ 25 (2022), which further informed the World Bank’s engagement and activities in Serbia.
    However, it is important to note that external shocks can significantly affect the pace of implementation and
    priorities, as it was evident during the energy crisis in 2022 and the subsequent heightened geopolitical risks.

VI. LESSONS AND NEXT PHASE

 A. Lessons Learned

42. The DPL is a strong instrument in supporting complex reform areas, particularly when there is a solid analytical
    background and continuous client engagement. The context, development objectives, and reforms supported by
    this operation are assessed to be appropriate and consistent with the goals of the government’s economic program
    of maintaining macroeconomic stability through higher efficiency of public spending and to ensuring higher and
    more sustainable growth that is preserving and restoring the natural environment. The reforms were informed not
    only by extensive World Bank engagement in these areas and consequent analytical and technical work, but also
    by analytical work done by the government, development partners, which was further enhanced through a wider
    dialogue with all relevant stakeholders (academia, civil sector organizations, and private sector).

43. Results indicators should be specific, clearly defined, measurable, and easily verifiable, preferably online.
    Assessing the success of the agreed reform actions requires results indicators that are specific, clearly defined,
    measurable, and based on clear evidence and data. This operation included result indicators that were defined as
    estimates of estimates, leaving space for ambiguity. It was also very difficult to verify such result indicators.
    Preferably, all result indicators should be easily verifiable through online publication of data or reports published
    by government institutions. In that regard, communication with the government counterparts on result indicators
    is important to clarify the responsibilities for monitoring and data collection during the preparatory stage.
    Furthermore, all baseline and target years for all result indicators should be aligned, to avoid confusion.

44. Good cooperation with other international partners, and ideally joint policy dialogue and financing, is important
    for enhanced impact. The World Bank team held regular consultations not only with the relevant Serbian
    counterparts, but also other development partners. This operation was financed in parallel by AFD, that provided
    additional technical support for PAs in Pillar 2, that enabled a more comprehensive and coordinated policy dialogue
    on the green agenda. Strong partnership with the AFD continued in the subsequent programmatic DPL (P177410)
    and had also provided a platform for the KfW involvement, which supported the energy sector reforms. The
    dialogue between the Bank and KfW started during this operation, the success of which was critical for the KfW’s
    involvement. Close coordination and communication with EU institutions was also critical, as most of the reforms
    supported by this operation are also very important for and are in great part anchored in the EU accession process
    of Serbia. Furthermore, the World Bank coordinated closely with the IMF, and the objectives of the DPL were
    consistent with those of the IMF Policy Coordination Instrument approved in June 2021, that aimed at supporting
    the recovery from the pandemic, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and anchoring the medium-term fiscal
    policy framework, while pushing ahead with structural reforms to deliver more inclusive and sustainable growth.

45. It is vital that there is a strong government ownership of reforms. Some of the reforms supported by this
    operation were socially and politically sensitive (e.g., controlled employment in the public sector, creating an
    independent institution for state aid to monitor state aid provided for compliance with the law, limiting the use of
    cheaper heavy fuel oil). In that regard, a key factor for the implementation of these reforms and progress achieved
    was strong government ownership. The reforms were supported and driven by key institutions, which was critical
    for their facilitation and implementation. The government ownership was further enhanced by close collaboration
    among and coordinated support of development partners. The EU accession process was a key anchor for reforms.

46. The World Bank remains engaged in the key reform areas of the operation. The DPF1 of a new programmatic
    Green Transition DPF series (P177410) with two operations was approved in March 2022. Building on the previous
    policy program, the new series is deepening and expanding structural reforms towards more sustainable medium-
    term growth. The objective of this operation is to support the Government of Serbia’s efforts to: 1) better align
    fiscal management with the climate-change agenda, 2) accelerate the clean energy transition, and 3) align with EU
    standards on environment and climate action. Reflecting the importance of coordination policy dialogue, the
    successor Green Transition DPL Series is co-financed by both AFD and KfW and is closely aligned with the successor
    IMF Stand-By Arrangement. Furthermore, in March 2023, the World Bank approved US$75 million in financing for
    the Improving Public Financial Management for the Green Transition Project (P175655), which aims to strengthen
    core public financial management functions and enhance institutional capacities for achieving a green transition.
    This operation is also co-financed with AFD, demonstrating the continued relevance and scaling-up of the joint
    platform established with AFD in Serbia on key green transition reforms and investments. In the framework of this
    operation and the ongoing policy dialogue and country engagement, the Bank continues to provide technical
    assistance in many areas, particularly in supporting the green transition.

    ANNEX 3. BORROWER, CO-FINANCIERS, AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS’/STAKEHOLDERS’ COMMENTS


Government of Serbia

The draft ICR was discussed during an implementation support mission undertaken in December 2023. The views of the
Government have been incorporated into the final version of the ICR. The final draft was shared with the Government of
Serbia in December 2023. While no additional comment was provided to the final written version, many of the lessons
learned and the results reflected in the document, notably on the success of the DPL, are the results of the close discussions
with the authorities.


Agence Française de Développement (AFD)

AFD extends warm gratitude to the World Bank (WB) teams for the opportunity to provide insights and contributions to
this ICR. On this occasion, we wish to highlight the rationale and key factors for the exceptional collaboration developed
with the WB over the last three years in Serbia and in the Western Balkans, focusing on critical reforms and investment
related to Green transition:

-   The partnership established between the AFD and the WB in the Western Balkans is one of the most dynamic among
    the different regions with active WB-AFD co-financing: Indeed, the cumulative amount of the portfolio in parallel or
    joint co-financing in the region is now approximately €2 billion. In terms of impact, it is in the upper range when
    compared to population by region.

-   This "Public Sector Efficiency and Green Recovery DPL (164575)” was one of the triggers and vectors at the origin of
    this dynamic: the successful first cooperation and joint dialogue with Serbia established through this DPL let the way
    for the building-up of a very significant joint portfolio in the country, with a strong replication potential in the region.
    This portfolio is associated with a multi-year, context-responsive programming approach, mobilizing almost all of the
    financing instruments (e.g.: DPOs, PforRs, IPFs) shared by our two institutions. This joint Serbia portfolio currently
    includes seven projects: five effective for the period 2021-23, and two contemplated for approval in 2024, for a total
    amount of €1.3 billion, split equally between AFD and the WB.

-   This operation and its extensions (i.e. the subsequent Serbia DPL series; the “Improving Public Financial Management
    for the Green Transition Project” PforR) illustrate and deepen the AFD-WB strategic approach of co-constructing
    ambitious and innovative solutions on Green Transition – covering inter alia climate, energy, air quality, transport,
    waste management policies/investments – which deployment is critical for Serbia's EU accession pathway. In this
    context, each institution mobilizes its expertise and financial capacities to increase the desired effect, with a strong
    contribution from the AFD, in the context of this DPL, to deepen the dialogue on climate action and related
    impacts/Climate Co-Benefits.

-   This collaborative effort is bolstered through technical assistance, facilitated by dedicated AFD funds for (i) project
    preparation, prior to the entry into force of the loans, and (ii) afterwards, for support in the implementation of reforms
    and investments, including through the mobilization of cooperation instruments between European and Serbian public
    institutions.
