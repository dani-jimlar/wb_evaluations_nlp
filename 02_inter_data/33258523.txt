a. Objectives

The program document (PD1) for the First Programmatic Shared Prosperity Development Policy Loan (DPL1) for
Panama stated the project development objectives (PDOs) as: “to support the Government of Panama’s efforts to
(i) expand inclusion and opportunities, (ii) improve service delivery, and (iii) modernize fiscal management.” The
Second and Third loans in the series (DPL2 and DPL3) restated, reordered, and specified the development
objectives as: “to support the Government of Panama’s efforts to: (i) strengthen the frameworks for international
tax transparency, financial integrity, and fiscal management; (ii) strengthen institutional arrangements to support
social assistance and education; and (iii) enhance the regulatory and sustainability framework in the energy and
water sectors” (PD3, p. v).

 The objectives remained broadly consistent throughout the series, although the ordering, wording, and specificity
of the objectives changed between operations. For the purposes of this ICRR, the PDOs are stated as follows:

Strengthen social programs;

Strengthen public service delivery in water and energy;

Strengthen fiscal management.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
For the purpose of this ICRR, each objective has two Pillars/Policy Areas:

Objective 1: Strengthen social programs:

Pillar 1: Institutional arrangements to support education;

Pillar 2: Institutional arrangements to support social assistance.

Objective 2: Strengthen public service delivery in water and energy:

Pillar 3: Water and sanitation management;

Pillar 4: Regulatory and sustainability framework of service delivery in the energy sector.

Objective 3: Strengthen fiscal management:

Pillar 5: Fiscal management;

Pillar 6: Financial integrity and international tax transparency.

 These correspond broadly to the pillars stated in the PDs, though with some differences in wording and pre-
eminence given to Pillars 5 and 6 in DPO2 and DPO3. Pillars 1 and 2 each had two clusters of five Policy
Actions (PAs) over the three operations. Pillar 3 had only one PA in DPO1, and no follow-up. Pillar 4 had two
clusters of three PAs. Pillar 5 had four clusters of seven PAs. Pillar 6 had three clusters of five PAs. Counting all
sub-actions in PAs that had two or more parts, the total number of specific actions was 11 in DPO1, 15 in DPO2,


                                                                                                       Page 3 of 29

and 13 in DPO3. These pillars and PAs are summarized in Table 1 and discussed in Section 3 below. Table 1
also shows the original pillars as restated in each operation.

The total cost of the series was US$700 million. An IBRD loan of US$300 million for DPL1 was approved by the
World Bank Board of Executive Directors on April 7, 2015 and disbursed on July 31, 2015. A loan of US$300
million for DPL2 was approved on September 8, 2016 and disbursed on December 15, 2016. A third loan of
US$100 million was approved on June 15, 2018 and disbursed on August 20, 2018. A planned fourth DPL was
not undertaken, due in part to the complexity and time required for implementation, with some actions deferred
to a subsequent DPO series and collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC).


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 The Shared Prosperity DPO series was designed in a time of exceptionally high economic growth, which
 enabled measures to address inequality and poverty (through cash transfers, educational reforms, and
 improving delivery or water and electricity services) while tackling issues of fiscal management (including
 international tax transparency and financial integrity concerns). By the time the series began in 2015,
 however, GDP growth had slowed to 5.7 percent, and continued to decline to 3.7 percent in 2018, from an
 average of 7.2 percent over 2003-13 (ICR, pp. 6-7).

 The objective to strengthen social programs was highly relevant to the government’s desire to translate the
 strong growth in GDP into greater inclusion of and opportunities for the broader population. Although poverty
 had fallen along with growth (from 39.9 percent to 26.2 percent over 2007-12), the government that came to
 power in 2014 was committed to implementing the Indigenous Peoples’ National Development Plan to
 address key challenges: (a) prosperity had not reached everyone, in particular the indigenous and youth; and
 (b) limited coverage and quality of basic services, notably electricity, water, and sanitation (PD1, p. 1). The
 Development Plan had been developed through a lengthy consultative process, and proposed “a multi-
 sectoral, proactive strategy for engagement and investments for and with Indigenous Peoples” (PD1, p. 12).

 The lack of basic services was directly addressed by the objective to strengthen public service delivery in
 water and energy. From the 2010 census, only 28 percent of indigenous populations had access to potable
 water, compared to 93 percent nationally (78 percent in rural areas; PD1, p. 16). The failure of electricity
 supply to keep up with demand was resulting in increased emergency rationing measures (especially in the
 dry season) and excessive budgetary subsidies (PD1, p. 18). The government was undertaking to adjust and
 better target subsidies and diversify energy sources (PD1, p. 19).

 The relevance of the objective to modernize fiscal management (PD1, p. iv) increased substantially with the
 leaking of documents (the “Panama papers”) related to offshore companies and money laundering, which
 heightened concerns related to "graylisting" of Panama by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force
 (FATF) (PD2, p. 2). This led to specification of international tax transparency and financial integrity as part of
 the fiscal management objective and elevation of this pillar to primary position, with indirect relevance to
 effective implementation of the other objectives and to restoring Panama’s international financial reputation
 as a basis for continued foreign investment and economic growth.

 The objectives were directly aligned with those stated in the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework
 (CPF) for FY15-FY21:

Objective 6: Strengthen resilience to natural disasters

Objective 7: Support integrated water resources management in priority areas

DPO Objective 1 to strengthen social programs was relevant to CPF Objective 4; DPO Objective 2 to
strengthen public service delivery was relevant to CPF Objectives 2, 5 and 7; and DPO Objective 3 to
strengthen fiscal management was relevant to CPF Objectives 3 and 6. The design for implementation of the
latter objective was driven by dialogue and lessons learned from a previous DPL series for Programmatic
Fiscal Management and Efficiency of Expenditures, 2012-2014 (ICR, p. 27).


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The ICR clearly sets out the theory of change underlying the PAs (ICR, Table 2) and their analytical
underpinnings (Annex 7), and the program documents generally provided evidence supporting the need for
and design of the actions. The PAs referred to below are presented in Table 1 (above).

 Pillar 1 included two clusters with five actions to support education through cash incentives and vocational
training. PA1 was highly and directly relevant to reducing dropout rates (averaging over 40 percent in 2011
for secondary school; PD1, p. 14) by increasing the Beca Universal program (targeted scholarships across
different tiers of education), based on evidence that such cash transfers can significantly reduce school
dropout rates (PD1, p. 14). PA2 was intended to improve monitoring and evaluation of performance.
(Relevance of PA1 = HS and PA2 = S)

PA3 supported relevant groundwork to promoting on-the-job training of technical graduates. The relatively
high youth unemployment rate (three times the national average) was attributed in part to their lack of skills
necessary to access higher quality employment (PD1, p. 1). A pilot program for on-the-job training
demonstrated positive impact on labor market prospects of participants; ICR, p. 24). PA4 and PA5 were

indirectly relevant through programs to support roll-out and bilingual teachers. (Relevance of PA3, PA4, and
PA5 = S)

Pillar 2 promoted social protection through two clusters of five actions relating to cash transfers and their
payment mechanisms. PA6 was highly satisfactory in directly addressing the objective by expanding benefits
to the elderly who lacked pensions. PAs 7-9 represented administrative measures relevant to expanding,
overseeing, and targeting cash transfer programs and to improving access to health and education services
(especially for the rural and indigenous poor). Health indicators showed rates of malnutrition, child mortality,
and teenage pregnancy in indigenous areas several times the national averages (PD1, p. 12). Lack of quality
education was identified as one cause of relatively poor employment prospects (PD1, p. 2). (Relevance of
PA6 = HS; PA7, PA8, and PA9 = S)

PA10 complemented the cash transfer programs by promoting payment through the social card (Clave
Social) for greater security and transparency in handling a growing volume of transactions. (Relevance of
PA10 = S)

Pillar 3 was intended to support improvement of water and sanitation in rural areas. PA11 supported
establishment of management and monitoring systems as a basis for expansion of rural water and sanitation.
While PA11 was very relevant to implementation of action plans to expand water and sanitation, in light of
significant challenges in the sector, subsequent triggers were not translated into any further PAs for water
after DPO1; the rationale and implications of this lack of follow-up were not explicitly addressed in either the
ICR or PD2. (Relevance of PA11 = S)

 Pillar 4 addressed electricity subsidies, sustainability, and regulation. It had two clusters of three PAs (two of
which had two distinct sub-actions). PA12 addressed the underlying policy and legal framework. PA13 was
highly relevant to the key objective of reducing budgetary costs of electricity subsidies through a specific
measure to improve targeting. PA14 was intended to lay the groundwork to dampen the growth of demand
through enhanced energy efficiency standards for buildings. (Relevance of PA13 = HS; PA12 and PA 14 =S)

Pillar 5 was intended to modernize fiscal management, including management of funds and debt, disaster
risk management, financial integrity, and decentralization. It had four clusters of seven PAs (of which three
were follow-ups). PAs 15-17 represented a highly relevant sequence of actions to improve fiscal
management by integrating all central government budgetary accounts into a Single Treasury Account
(PA15) linked to a financial information management system (PA16) and bringing all central government
accounts under this system (PA17). The lack of a single treasury account for government revenues and
expenses had been identified (PD1, p. 19) as a “major challenge [for] better management of public resources
and an adequate evaluation of how resources are transferred.” (Relevance of PA15, PA16, and PA 17 = HS)

PAs18-21 addressed additional aspects of fiscal management that had been identified in the analytical work
underpinning the series. PAs 18-19 established policy and planning for managing fiscal risks of natural
disasters. PA20 represented an agreement to bring public debt servicing under the Single Treasury Account
platform. PA21 related to decentralization and coordination of government revenues and expenditures.
(Relevance of PA 18, PA19, PA20, and PA 21 = S)

Pillar 6 was intended to address international concerns about Panama’s financial integrity and tax
transparency that had arisen from the disclosure of documents. PA22 strengthened bank supervision, and
PA23 strengthened the legal basis for prosecuting money laundering, both essential steps toward addressing
allegations concerning a Panamanian conglomerate (PD2, p. 7). (Relevance of PA22 and PA23 = S)


                                                                                                      Page 10 of 29

 PAs 24-26 addressed international tax transparency and compliance through a sequence of actions to
 conform with Common Reporting Standards for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information on Tax
 Matters, to address the problems emanating from the leaking of documents and graylisting of Panama by
 FATF. The PAs were oriented toward the 2003 standards by which Panama had been graylisted; they proved
 insufficient to prevent subsequent graylisting by the 2012 standards, which were expected to be addressed
 through subsequent operations. (Relevance of PA24, PA25, and PA26 = S)

  Rationale

 The number of policy areas addressed in each operation was reasonable, though at the upper limit of what
 might be considered manageable in such a series (the number of specific actions exceeded ten in each DPO,
 if sub-actions within a PA are counted). DPO1 had seven PAs (four of them with two sub-actions); DPO2
 introduced four new primary PAs and six follow-ups (with a total of 15 individual actions/sub-actions). DPO3
 introduced three new primary PAs and six follow-ups. All but one (for water) of the actions initiated in DPO1
 had appropriate follow-up actions in DPO2 and/or DPO3, taking advantage of the series to ensure
 implementation as well as initiation of a process of reform. The planned but cancelled DPO4 was expected to
 follow up on the three new PAs introduced in DPO3; the new DPO series for “Pandemic Response and
 Growth Recovery” does include a pillar and some actions related to financial transparency and reducing tax
 evasion.

  All of the Pillars are rated as Satisfactory. Overall, 6 out of the 26 PAs are rated HS, based on their strong
 direct relevance to achievement of the intended outcomes. Many of them represented satisfactory steps to
 establish the legal and institutional framework necessary to achieve the stated objectives. The PAs were
 generally relevant to the government’s stated objectives and development plan and to the Bank’s CPF, as
 well as based on strong analytical underpinnings to actions embedded in clear results chains.

4. Relevance of Results Indicators

Rationale

Table 2 presents the original RIs and targets along with the 13 that were finally adapted or adopted to measure
results as of the end of the series, along with their associated PAs. The ICR explains adjustments that were
made in the 13 RIs that were retained. Although it does not explain the reasons for dropping/replacing nine of
the original RIs, the project team clarified that this was primarily due to the refocusing on financial and tax issues
starting in DPO2.

Pillar 1 had two indicators to measure progress in strengthening institutional arrangements to support education.

RI 2 aimed to increase the number of policy reports informed by the use of student assessment data from 0 to 2.
Although this focus on improving the monitoring and evaluation of student performance was an appropriate step
toward improving educational outcomes, this was only an indirect measure. However, it would not have been
feasible to obtain regular direct evidence on the impact of cash payment incentives on school attendance (apart
from periodic studies), and DPO2 reasonably opted to focus on improving the use of student assessment data in
reporting. (Relevance of RI 2 = S)

RI 4 relates to the quality of education by monitoring the number of teachers participating in the International
Teacher Training of Panama Bilingue. While reasonable as a necessary step toward improving the quality of
education, this indicator is not as directly related to outcome as the original indicator of the share of students

graduating from the ProJoven training program (neither the PDs nor the ICR explain why this more direct
indicator was dropped, even though “the Government wants to use the ProJoven program to increase
employment opportunities of vulnerable youth from households living in extreme poverty”; PD2, p. 25).
(Relevance of RI 4 = S)

Pillar 2 had two indicators of strengthening institutional arrangements to support social assistance.

RI 7 measures the percentage of the extreme poor benefiting from at least one social assistance program, and
is highly relevant as a direct indicator of the outcome of expanded coverage of social protection programs.
(Relevance of RI 7 = HS)

RI 8 monitors the percentage of total funds from social assistance programs that are transferred through the
social card (Clave Social), and is highly relevant to the objectives of increasing the security and transparency of
transfers along with their volume, as well as the additional result of promoting financial inclusion among those
with no previous use of formal financial mechanisms. (Relevance of RI 8 = HS)

Pillar 3 had one indicator intended to measure progress toward strengthening public service delivery in water
and sanitation. RI 10 monitors the number of rural water boards connected to the Rural Water and Sanitation
Information System (SIASAR). Although only indirectly related to the fundamental objective of expanding access
to drinking water and latrines (included in PA11 and RI 9 in DPO1, but subsequently dropped [without
explanation] to focus on the management and regulatory framework), the project team noted that poor water
management (due to too many agencies with poor information-sharing) is more of a constraint on access to
water than availability per se. (Relevance of RI 10 = MS)

Pillar 4 had one indicator of progress in enhancing the regulatory and sustainability framework of service
delivery in the energy sector. RI 12 measures the extent to which public expenditures on electricity subsidies
have been reduced and is highly and directly relevant to the stated objective of enhancing the financial
sustainability of electricity by reducing the fiscal burden (through better targeting). While this is only an interim
result toward the longer-term intended outcome of expanded and more reliable supply of electricity, the time
frame for the results chain from improved financial sustainability to investment to improved electricity supply lies
outside the period of the DPO series, and it was reasonable to drop the original indicator (RI 7) of reduced
outages. (Relevance of RI 12 = HS)

Pillar 5 had four RIs related to various aspects of fiscal management.

RI 13, which monitors the share of public funds channeled through the Single Treasury Account, and RI 17,
concerning the share of central government debt paid electronically, are both highly and directly relevant to the
objective of enhancing the transparency and efficiency of management of public funds. (Relevance of RI 13 and
RI 17 = HS)

RI 16 indicates steps toward identifying and analyzing financial protection instruments to cope with the fiscal
consequences of disasters. RI18 represents an important step toward decentralizing improvements in fiscal
management norms and procedures to local governments. (Relevance of RI 16 and RI 18 = S)

Pillar 6 had three RIs related to financial integrity and international tax transparency.

RI 19 (the number of banks supervised on-site on AML/CFT matters) and RI 20 (the number of money
laundering investigations with tax evasion as a predicate criminal offense) are intended to indicate improvement
in financial integrity in Panama’s financial system. Addressing deficiencies in Panama’s framework for anti-

                                                                                                      Page 15 of 29

money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) was essential for restoring Panama’s
international standing and hence access to financing and investment; indeed, Panama was removed from the
FATF greylist in 2016 (PD3, p. 11). The number of investigations for money laundering using tax evasion as a
charge are a reasonable first step, but only indirectly indicates the extent to which money laundering is being
discouraged, in the absence of direct evidence of follow-through in the form of prosecutions (and convictions).
(Relevance of RI 19 = HS and RI 20 = MS)

participating actively and automatically in the international exchange of financial account and tax information

  This review agrees with the assessment in the ICR that the RIs were “were largely appropriate for assessing
  whether the program objectives were reached and could be clearly attributed to the individual prior actions”
  (ICR, p. 29). The ICR discusses the RIs and achievement of results in detail. It clearly explains modifications
  made to the RIs and targets in response to implementation of PAs and introduction of new ones (though it does
  not explain why some were dropped) (ICR, pp.13-14). These adjustments appear well-considered and
  appropriate. In the end, each PA cluster had a unique and appropriate RI associated with it (except that financial
  integrity had two RIs, associated with each of the two PAs introduced in DPO3). Seven of the 13 RIs were
  considered highly satisfactory as measures of achievement of the objective of the associated PAs; only in the
  cases of water and tax evasion was the RI found to be less than satisfactory. The ICR properly noted that “some
  results indicators focused more on outputs than outcomes,” but this was warranted to make them attributable to
  PAs whose ultimate impact would not be realized within the time frame of the series (ICR, p. 29).

  The majority of individual RIs were rated HS, with most of them concentrated under Objective 3 (Pillars 5 and 6).
  Pillars 2 (with two RIs) and 4 (with one RI) are also rated HS. Pillar 2 (with two indicators) is rated S, while Pillar
  3 (with one indicator) is rated MS. Overall rating is S.

               PAs 1-5 supported cash incentives and job training programs that had proven effective. However, given the
               lack of good “evidence regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of student support programs,” the RIs
               focused more on measures to improve and systematize performance assessments to better support an

Outcomes

One education report (against a target of two and a baseline of none) was published using data from test
results (RI 2 = Modest). The number of teachers who participated in the International Teacher Training as part
of Panama Bilingüe reached 6,260 in 2019, well above the target of 3,500 (against a baseline of 0 in 2014)
(ICR, p. 41) (RI 4 = High). These results can be attributed to PAs 4-5.

Rating

Moderately Satisfactory    [At least half of pillar targets S or better]

Pillar 2: Institutional arrangements to support social assistance

Rationale

Conditional cash transfers (CCT) were a key policy instrument to translate strong economic growth
performance into poverty reduction. PAs 6-10 under Pillar 1 supporting Objective 1 were aimed at addressing
challenges “related to weak targeting mechanisms, gaps in coverage, [and] leakage of benefits” (ICR, p. 39).
Improving school drop-out rates and the quality of education was considered critical to enhance employment
opportunities, for youth in particular.

Main Outputs

The Government expanded access of the elderly to cash transfers, and conducted “an audit of beneficiaries
of the Red de Oportunidades [Opportunities Network] program that led to the identification and exclusion of
nearly 10,000 households (out of about 70,000 households) that did not qualify for the program” (ICR, p. 39).
It “created a Social Development Directorate to strengthen the management and coordination of all CCT
programs”; instituted “the regular update of the registry of beneficiaries; and prioritized poor and vulnerable
households” (ICR, p. 39).

Outcomes

The percentage of the extreme poor benefiting from at least one social assistance program reached 81
percent in 2018, as against a baseline of 37 percent in 2014, exceeding the target of 60 percent for 2019
(ICR, p. 40) (RI 7 = High). This result can be attributed to PA6 to expand coverage. Use of the social card for
payments through the National Bank of Panama increased to 80 percent by 2019, as against a baseline of 0
in 2014, exceeding the target of 35 percent for 2019, and attributable to PA10 (RI 8 = High).

Hence both targets were exceeded [High].

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Strengthen public service delivery in water and energy

Rationale
Pillar 3: Improve water and sanitation management

Rationale

Although Panama had achieved near universal access to drinkable water in urban areas, rural areas lagged
behind, especially for indigenous populations. However, “the Government lacks accurate and up-to-date
information to make appropriate use of its water resources” (ICR, p. 43). Because of poor water management
due to the multiplicity of authorities and lack of information-sharing for more efficient utilization of available
supply (which depends heavily on draw-downs for operation of the Canal), it was considered that the “first
institutional step to create a reliable, timely, good quality, and publicly available water resources information
system” would be to link rural water boards to the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System (SIASAR).

Main Outputs

“Institutional reforms of the water management were expected to strengthen the management of water
resources” (ICR, p. 43).

Outcomes

The number of rural water boards connected to SIASAR rose from the 2014 baseline of 400 to 684 as of
November 2020, representing an increase of 284 or 22 percent of the targeted increase of 1300 (ICR, pp. 43-
44), attributable to PA11 (though not directly measuring the intended result of increased access to water and
sanitation in rural areas; the ICR did not provide any additional evidence on this aspect, and the project
team did not think it likely that substantially more progress has been made). (RI 10 = Modest)

[Note: The RI was rated in the ICR as “Not Achieved,” i.e., “Negligible.” However, it appears to have actually
been 22 percent achieved, permitting a rating of Modest. The ultimate outcome of access to water was
achieved inasmuch as the share of the rural population using at least basic drinking water services rose from
87.4 percent during 2010-14 before the series, to 97.1 percent for 2015-17 during the series (World
Development Indicators), albeit continuing the trend over the last two decades, and not necessarily
attributable to the series.]

Pillar 4: Enhance the regulatory and sustainability framework of service delivery in the energy sector

Rationale

The gap between growing demand for electricity and supply, due to “delays in investments related to the
transmission system and power generation capacity, and slow progress on diversification of power
generation… have exposed the energy sector to the volatility of international oil prices, making the system
vulnerable to energy outages” (ICR, p. 42). Putting the energy sector on a more sustainable financial footing,
as well as regulating energy usage in new buildings and promoting diversified energy sources, were
considered essential both to close the supply-demand gap and to realize Panama’s global commitments on
climate change (ICR, p. 41). In preparation for DPO1, the government had raised electricity tariffs, but needed
to reduce the budgetary drain of subsidies, in particular by more effective targeting.

Main Outputs

The “Government improved the targeting of electricity tariff subsidies” by replacing the country-wide approach
with a geographically-targeted fund, and “the Ministry of Commerce published the energy efficiency technical
standards for air conditioners, making them binding (ICR, pp. 41-42).

Outcomes

Electricity subsidies were reduced by nearly 80 percent (the target for 2017-19) in 2017 to US$65.7 million,
aided by a temporary drop in international oil prices, but then rose to an average of US$142.7 million for
2017-19 as a result of a rise in oil prices, “losses derived from the delay in the construction of the third electric
transmission line,” and customer demonstrations against increased electricity tariffs in 2018 (ICR, p. 42). This
represented a 55 percent reduction in subsidies, or 69 percent of the targeted rate of reduction, attributable to
PAs 12-13 (RI 12 = Substantial). [Note: the targeted average for 2017-19 is stated in the ICR (p.41) as
US$50 million, but should be US$62 million for consistency with the targeted drop of at least 80 percent from
the baseline of US$320 million. The original target of a 50 percent reduction was 89 percent achieved.]

Pillar 5: Strengthen the framework for fiscal management

Rationale

A major challenge to effective fiscal management in Panama was identified as the “lack of a centralized
treasury account for Government revenues and expenses which would allow better management of public
resources and an adequate evaluation of how resources are transferred” (PD1, p. 19). Effective debt
monitoring and management likewise depended on moving to electronic payment and integration with a
comprehensive financial information management system (ISTMO). At the same time, the budgetary process
was considered to be over-centralized, with “the bulk of public investment and service provision
responsibilities and resources to address the needs of the population concentrated in Central Government
and exercised by line ministries” (ICR, pp. 34-35). The importance of “safeguarding public finances from the
financial implications of natural hazards” had also been identified as a major fiscal management concern, in
view of Panama’s risk of incurring natural disasters (ranging from forest fires to earthquakes and tsunamis),
which could seriously impact GDP and government finances. Actions in these areas were designed to build
on previous DPO series. (PD1, pp. 35-36)

Main Outputs

As indicated in the PAs, the Government created the Single Treasury Account and developed an integrated
system for government resource planning (ISTMO), and brought “over 5,800 bank accounts of the Central
Government and public sector entities” under this system, “with the support of a World Bank investment loan”
(ICR, pp. 37-38). “Under DPL2, the Government took an important step to promote fiscal decentralization with
the enactment of an amendment to the Law on Decentralization which aimed to gradually reduce municipal
governments’ financial dependence on Central Government” (ICR, p. 35).

Outcomes

By the end of 2019, the target of “90 percent of payments of Central Government institutions and
decentralized entities channeled through the TSA” was met (from a baseline of 0) (RI 13 = High); “the share
of Central Government debt that is paid electronically increased from 0 percent in 2014 to 100 percent,”
exceeding the target of 90 percent, from a baseline of 0 (ICR, p.38) (RI 17 = High); and the target of “70
percent of all local investment projects rigorously evaluated by SINIP procedures” was achieved (as against a
baseline of 0) (RI 18 = High). A total of three disaster risk management (DRM) instruments were analyzed,
exceeding the target of two (from a benchmark of 0), and putting “Panama at the global frontier in the area of
DRM” (ICR, p. 37) (RI 16 = High).

Rating

Highly Satisfactory [all Pillar RI targets are rated High]

Pillar 6: Strengthen the framework for financial integrity and international tax transparency

The need to address international tax transparency and financial integrity became dramatically apparent as

                                                                                                 Page 21 of 29

well as “graylisting” of Panama by FATF (ICR, p. 27; DP2, pp. 6-7). Hence appropriate actions were added
under the overall objective of strengthening fiscal management.

Main Outputs

Regarding financial integrity, Panama “successfully addressed AML/CFT deficiencies, [and] was removed
from the FATF "Gray List" in February 2016.” Furthermore, “Panama passed a law that criminalizes tax
evasion and establishes tax crimes as a predicate offence to money laundering, translating into the legal
framework one of the key elements of the revised FATF recommendations” (ICR, p. 34).

With respect to international tax transparency, Panama incorporated the requirements of CRS into domestic
legislation, and engaged in exchange of information with 32 countries in 2018, rising to 58 in 2019. It also
signed the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and the MCAA on
Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (ICR, p. 30).

[Note: Although “Panama was removed from the FATF ‘Gray List’ in February 2016 based on compliance
under the 2003 FATF standards,” subsequent revisions in standards led to Panama being included “in the
new list of 23 countries with strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT frameworks adopted by the European
Union (EU) in February 2019, and Panama’s re-inclusion into the FATF graylist around the same time.” Thus,
“Panama has not yet succeeded in irrevocably removing itself from the EU or FATF graylists” (ICR, pp. 32-
33). Although removal from graylisting was not specified as a results indicator, Panama’s re-inclusion after
completion of the series represents a caveat on the S rating. Nonetheless, the new DPO series for “Panama
Pandemic Response and Growth Recovery Development Policy” does include a pillar, triggers, PAs and RI to
continue progress in financial integrity, transparency and tax evasion.]

Outcomes

Regarding financial integrity, the number of banks supervised according to new AML/CFT standards rose
from the 2014 baseline of 0 to 75 by end-2019, exceeding the target of 55 (RI 19 = High). Although “the
number of money laundering investigations where tax evasion is a predicate criminal offence increased from
zero to 2 at the end of 2019,” as targeted (ICR, p. 34), RI 20 is rated Substantial rather than High for lack of
evidence that this small number of investigations is likely to lead to actual prosecutions for tax evasion, let
alone convictions.

With respect to international tax transparency, Panama was both sending and receiving financial information
for tax purposes with other countries on an automatic basis, as targeted (RI 22 = High).

OVERALL EFF TBL OLD




Overall Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
Rationale

The program exceeded over half of its 13 targets and fell below two-thirds achievement in only two cases. Cash
assistance programs for the extreme poor have been both expanded and better targeted, especially to
indigenous populations. Steps have been taken to improve educational quality in terms of both English and
vocational skills. The fiscal sustainability of electricity subsidies has been partially improved. Participation of rural
water boards in information systems for better water management has been enhanced (though the impact on
access to water remains to be seen and may be adversely affected by decreasing availability). Significant
improvements have been made in fiscal management, in particular with respect to centralizing budgetary and
debt management for greater transparency and efficiency, disaster risk management, international tax
transparency, and bank supervision for compliance with international AML/CFT standards.

     Efficacy was rated as follows by Pillar:

                      1.   MS
                      2.   HS

                      5.   HS
                      6.   S

Almost all of the RIs were closely related to the PAs, which themselves were highly relevant to the objectives.
Hence the positive outcomes can reasonably be attributed to the actions.

 Note: The ICR rated Efficacy as Moderately Satisfactory. This was based on averaging across 11 Policy Areas,
including water as a separate area with an Unsatisfactory rating based on non-achievement of the RI, which
turns out to have been partially achieved. None of the policy areas was rated Highly Satisfactory in the ICR.
Under the revised ICRR rating procedures, the result of averaging across six Pillars/Policy Areas is an overall
efficacy rating of 4.8 (on a 6-point scale) = Satisfactory.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Although still above average for the Latin American and Caribbean region, declining GDP growth in recent years
raises the risk that continued expansion of benefits to the lower-income, rural, and indigenous populations may
be increasingly difficult to sustain. The Covid-19 pandemic has heightened this risk, as the fiscal and
employment effects of a 10 percent drop in Panama Canal traffic in 2020 and a lockdown to cope with high
infection rates caused output to drop by an estimated 9 percent in 2020 (IMF, January 20, 2021, “Precautionary
Credit Line Provides Panama with Crisis Insurance”).

The risk to sustainability of fiscal management reforms is evidenced in the re-graylisting of Panama by FATF.
While this was attributable to updating of standards rather than backsliding on reforms, it signals that compliance
with fiscal management standards requires ongoing measures to continue upgrading beyond the series.
Furthermore, initial success in reducing the cost of electricity tariff subsidies was partially reversed by oil price
volatility and political resistance to rising tariffs, risks that may continue to threaten sustainability.

The ICR discussed four key areas of risk to the sustainability of development outcomes, as well as mitigation
measures:

Political: PD1 (p. 28) noted the risks that the National Assembly might not pass the laws needed to undertake
many of the reforms, and that lack of political will or changing priorities could undermine achievement of
objectives related to indigenous peoples and reducing inequality. Nonetheless, the ICR (pp. 47-48) noted that
these risks were mitigated by “consensus among the major political parties as well as the private sector on the
need to improve tax transparency and financial integrity,” and that the “government elected in July 2019 has
maintained the priorities” and has “the political capital to continue addressing challenges such as the growth
slowdown, a deteriorating fiscal position, the return to the FATF grey list, and the still-high rates of poverty and
inequality.”

Institutional capacity: The reforms regarding tax transparency and AML/CFT introduced in DPO2 posed
particular challenges regarding building capacity in regulatory agencies (some new), as well as in those being
supervised. The authorities have so far addressed these risks through high-level leadership of reforms and by
“seeking technical assistance from international institutions [including] advisory activities and technical
assistance from the WB, International Monetary Fund (IMF), IDB, OECD, and other development partners” (ICR,
p. 48).

Macroeconomics: While Panama’s macroeconomic framework was considered “sustainable and adequate”
throughout the series (DPO3, p. 10), as “a small, open and well-integrated economy, Panama is vulnerable to
external shocks,” especially fluctuations in usage of Panama Canal services and foreign direct investment (ICR,
p. 48), as well as a wide range of potential natural disasters. Both the current account deficit (fully funded by
foreign direct investment) and the fiscal deficit declined, although the latter rose in 2019 and 2020 due largely to

a construction strike and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. To mitigate fiscal risks and boost investor
confidence, Panama has obtained a US$2.7 billion “Precautionary and Liquidity Line” from the IMF (IMF,
January 20, 2021, “Precautionary Credit Line Provides Panama with Crisis Insurance”).

Stakeholders: Reforms related to social inclusion and cash transfers, including modifications to targeting and re-
certification of beneficiaries, “led to redistribution of resources within the program, which could be opposed by
some beneficiaries” (ICR, p. 49). This risk was addressed through a communication strategy and up-front
consultations with stakeholders, leading the risk assessment for stakeholders to be lowered from Substantial in
DP1 to Moderate in DP2 and DP3.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Program design built on lessons learned from prior operations in Panama and other middle-income countries,
especially the importance of “supporting Government-led initiatives to obtain ownership of reform” (PD1, p. 11).
In particular, “the legal and regulatory framework underpinning the reform program was initiated and developed
by the administration, with technical input from the World Bank,” and inclusion and social protection objectives
“were strategically aligned with the Government strategy” (PD1, p. 11).

The other main lesson cited was “ensuring strong analytical underpinnings.” This was done effectively, with PAs
drawing not only on WBG country diagnostic and expenditure reviews and technical assistance reports, as well
as IMF reports, but also on OECD reviews and independent evaluations of evidence from cash transfer,
technical training, and other social and education programs (ICR, Annex 7).

Risks and mitigation measures were fully addressed in the PDs and ICR. The risk assessment was raised from
Moderate in PD1 to Substantial in PD2 and PD3, largely due to the fallout from leakage of documents relating to
offshore companies and money laundering, which heightened concern for the political and institutional risks for
implementation. The assessment was raised from Low to Moderate for technical design, fiduciary, and
environmental and social risks; and from Moderate to Substantial for institutional capacity. The latter especially
concerned implementation of new tax transparency and AML/CFT reforms (which had not been in PD1),
although these were in fact implemented successfully, thanks in part to complementary technical assistance (an
important risk mitigation measure from the WBG perspective). Political risk was mitigated mainly by focusing on
reforms with strong Government ownership and commitment. Coping with the fiscal risks of natural disasters
was addressed in two PAs and an associated RI. The weakest areas with respect to risk mitigation were rural
water and sanitation and reducing electricity subsidies.

The focus of consultations was with the Government, to ensure strong ownership, and to some extent with
domestic stakeholders. In preparation for the first DPO, as well as the CPF, round table sessions with “the
Government, private sector, academia, think thanks, Indigenous Peoples, Afro Panamanian groups, civil society
and non-governmental organizations discussed the country’s development priorities and challenges for World
Bank Group future engagement” (PD1, p. 24).

However, apart from participation of several IMF staff members in the initial preparation team (though not in the
design of DPO2 or DPO3), there is no indication of coordination or consultation with other development partners,
apart from the provision of “advisory activities and technical assistance from the WB, International Monetary
Fund (IMF), IDB, OECD, and other development partners” to address specific international tax and fiscal
integrity issues (ICR, p. 53). The ICR (Annex 3) does not include any comments from development partners and
stakeholders.



Rating

Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

The series was adapted appropriately to changes in the situation (such as the need to address tax transparency
and AML/CFT in the wake of document leaks) and progress (or lack of it) in implementation. For example,
“under DPL2 some prior actions differed from the set of indicative triggers identified at the time of DPL1,
reflecting the varying speed of the reform implementation” (ICR, p. 47). Similarly, PD3 (p. 15) has a detailed
discussion of changes to triggers and dropping or revising PAs, as well as introduction of new triggers.

The ICR (p. 47) states that several supervision missions were undertaken, including shortly before the closing of
DPO3. The project team noted that formal supervision missions were not essential for monitoring and
supervision, which was done on a continuous basis through frequent missions to oversee the portfolio (which
was managed from Washington), resulting in on-going consultations with counterparts to complement almost
daily contact with the Ministry of Finance. The substantial adjustments to indicators and targets in DPO2 and
DPO3 reflect this oversight as well as the reorientation to focus more on financial and tax issues.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The cash transfer programs supported by the DPO series are extremely important for social inclusion and
poverty reduction, and the series “substantively expanded the coverage of extreme poor beneficiaries under
Red de Oportunidades, the poor elderly under the 120 at 65 Program, and extreme poor individuals with
disabilities under Ángel Guardián program” (ICR, p. 45). The result was a reduction in the poverty rate “from 23
percent in 2015 to an estimated 13.4 percent in 2018…. with the income of the bottom 40 percent of the
population growing faster than that of the national average [and a] Gini coefficient in 2018 (0.46) three
percentage point lower than in 2015 (0.49).” However, these gains may be substantially reversed by the impact
of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and employment, unless cash transfers continue to expand.

Although the improvements in the quality of educational and training services supported by the series have no
immediate impact on poverty, they are expected to “facilitate the school-to-labor market transition of youth over
the medium- and long-term” and improve the “equality of opportunities between private and public school
students that will lead to better prospects for these students in the labor markets and further education” (ICR, p.
45).



b. Environmental

Measures supported by the series to improve energy efficiency standards for new construction and incentivize
renewable energy are anticipated to lower emissions of air pollutants and help implement Panama’s
commitment to mitigate climate change (though it is not clear if these modifications will be sufficient to offset the
expected increase in electricity generation and usage).



c. Gender

“The DPL series did not identify or address gender aspects” (ICR, p. 45). The ICR notes that improvement in the
availability of good quality water in rural areas would especially benefit women, but it is not clear that such
improvement has taken place or can be attributed to the DPO series.

The ICR is thorough and well written. The country context and rationale for the operations are appropriately
described. Modifications to the objectives and pillars throughout the series are discussed in paras. 13 and 17-23

and Table 1, with particular attention to the reasons for significant modification in DPO2 (paras. 14-16 and 57).
Table 2 relates the PAs to the underlying theory of change, and the evolution of RIs is presented in paras. 24-25
and Annex 1, providing a good understanding of the anticipated chain from actions to results. The achievement
of results by indicator is thoroughly discussed (paras. 48-88).

Regarding outcomes, some data are provided on poverty and inequality (para. 93); it would have been useful to
have some additional data on access to water and electricity and whether the fiscal reforms affected Panama’s
ratings by Transparency International and Doing Business.

Although aspects of program design are thoroughly covered, not much information is provided on consultations
with other development partners (presumably because these were minimal) or on the specifics of how the series
was monitored and supervised (some missions are mentioned, but not the extent of support from the field
office).

12. Lessons

The ICRR concurs with key lessons that are articulated in the ICR.

Strong government ownership of the reform agenda is essential to ensure the implementation and
sustainability of a DPO series. Selecting program objectives and reforms that had wide public support as well as
political backing helped to ensure that the necessary legislation would be passed and implemented. It was
important that the “legal and regulatory framework underpinning the reform program was initiated and developed
by the Government, with technical inputs from the WB and other development partners” (ICR, p. 49). “The

                                                                                                   Page 28 of 29

Government continued to support the PDO beyond the closing of the DPL series,” in particular through a new
DPO series to carry forward actions that were originally intended for a fourth Shared Prosperity DPO but were
considered too complex to be implemented within the time frame.

Simple design based on strong analytical underpinnings and technical support are important for effective
design and implementation of appropriate interventions. The series focused on three main objectives that were
closely aligned with the Government’s Strategic Plan and priorities (as well as the Bank’s CPF) and had strong
analytical underpinnings, rather than trying to “cover an extensive array of measures” (ICR, p. 50).

Readiness to adapt to changing circumstances is important to ensure that the program remains relevant and
addresses emerging challenges. The most obvious example was the inclusion of new actions (within an existing
objective) to address the challenges to Panama’s international financial standing as a result of leaked
documents. Targets had to be adjusted periodically in response to monitoring the progress of implementation,
sometimes to be more realistic and sometimes more ambitious.

Continuing engagement beyond the series is important to sustain results by following through on
implementation and mitigating risks. In this case, a planned fourth DPO was instead rolled into a new DPO
series, enabling continued dialogue and actions focused on complex issues in order to deepen the reforms
initiated under this DPO series (which in turn was carrying forward some reforms initiated in previous
operations).

A further lesson is the importance of technical assistance that is timely and well-targeted to addressing
technical issues that arise or may impede implementation. Reforms to address tax transparency and fiscal
integrity – introduced after the series had begun – likely would not have been implemented so effectively without
bringing in expertise from the WBG and other development partners in these areas.
