2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   The PDO was to support the Recipient and the Participating States to strengthen: (a) the ICDS policy
   framework, systems and capacities, and facilitate community engagement, to ensure greater focus on
   children under three years old; and (b) convergent actions for improved nutrition outcomes (Financing
   Agreement, p.5).

   The initial operation envisaged a two-phased Adaptable Lending Program (APL) to improve nutritional
   outcomes of children in India (PAD, p. ii), but the APL approach was discontinued in 2015 (ICR, p. 7). The

                                                                                                  Page 1 of 21

   objectives were revised on March 30, 2018. The new PDO was to improve the coverage and quality of ICDS
   nutrition services to pregnant and lactating women and children under 3 years of age.

   Explanatory note on ICDS: According to ICR (p. 52), The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
   program is the Government of India’s flagship program that caters to pregnant/lactating women and 0-6-year-
   old children. It offers a range of services including supplementary food, health education, and immunization to
   enhance nutrition.

d. Components
   Component 1. ICDS Institutional and Systems Strengthening (Appraisal: US$ 62.80 million; Actual:
   197.81 million): The component aimed to enhance the effectiveness of the Integrated Child Development
   Services (ICDS) program. For the initial project (2012-2015), the envisioned activities revolved around six
   areas. The first was reviewing, refining, and aligning policies, guidelines, and procedures across ICDS
   structures, encompassing activities like human resource reform. The second was to broaden the ICDS
   monitoring and evaluation system by activities such as revising existing management practices and tools.
   The third involved capacity building, entailing the review and adaptation of training models and testing
   decentralized capacity-building methods. The fourth area was to bolster convergence between the ICDS
   program and another Indian government program, 'National Rural Health Mission', amplifying coordinated
   multi-sectoral nutrition efforts. The fifth area aimed to foster innovation through piloting initiatives such as
   adapting the ICDS program for urban settings. Finally, the activities under Component 1 aimed to fortify
   program leadership by enhancing leadership capacity at decentralized levels. Under the restructured project
   (2015-2018) and Additional Financing phase (2018-2021), the project activities under Component 1 shifted
   to narrower, high-impact interventions. Firstly, the project intended to enhance the capacities and skills of
   ICDS field workers and supervisory staff, employing the Incremental Learning-by-doing approach (ILA).
   Secondly, the project aimed to employ Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools for
   enhanced program management, monitoring, and beneficiary outreach.

   Component 2. Community Mobilization and Behavior Change Communication (BCC) Strengthening
   (Appraisal: US$ 27.30 million; Actual: 71.09 million): The component aimed to enhance community
   mobilization and strengthen behavior change communication. For the initial project (2012-2015), the project
   emphasized four sets of interventions. One, the project aimed to strengthen the supply and demand-side
   interface of the ICDS program. Two, the project intended to review past community participation
   experiences and piloting promising approaches, with plans to scale up successful pilots. Three, the project
   intended to promote community involvement through initiatives such as mothers' support groups and

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 21

  change agents, such as tribal leaders. This focus area also encompassed empowering community-based
  organizations and piloting partnerships with NGOs. Finally, the project intended to stimulate demand by
  strengthening BCC, including a review and analysis of existing BCC practices, and developing and
  implementing community-driven and evidence-based BCC strategies. The restructured project (2015-
  2018) and the Additional financing (2018-2021) focused on fewer high impact interventions. One, the
  project intended to implement an intensive mass media campaign on maternal, infant, and young child
  nutrition. Two, the project intended to strengthen community engagement through the organization and
  institutionalization of monthly community-based events.

  Component 3. Performance-Based Incentives (added during 2018-2021 Additional financing)
  Strengthening (Appraisal: US$ 0 million; Actual: 79.44 million): The component aimed to support
  performance-based incentives to ICDS field functionaries and state leadership. The project supported
  monthly incentives to ICDS field functionaries for specified positive outcomes such as home visits to
  prioritized households and organization of monthly village health and nutrition days, which were measured
  through the ICT monitoring tool. The project also included incentives to project states on the achievement of
  agreed upon outcome indicators.

  Component 4. Convergent Nutrition Action (Appraisal: US$ 0 million; Actual: 25.22 million): This
  component aimed to support the Government of India's efforts to initiate and expand a comprehensive
  convergent nutrition response to complement the ICDS to address the multiple determinants of malnutrition.
  Key activities under this component included development of frameworks and tools for facilitating multi-
  sectoral convergent actions, strengthening of structures at central and state levels for planning, coordination
  and monitoring nutrition actions across multiple sectors, development of action plans, and
  implementation/evaluation of pilots, focused evaluations, and operations research to systematically build the
  evidence base for convergent nutrition actions. The restructured project (2015-2018) and the Additional
  financing (2018-2021) focused on pilots and innovations to promote cross-sectoral convergence.

  Component 5. Project Management, Monitoring & Evaluation (Appraisal: US$ 0 million; Actual: 26.44
  million): This component aimed to support effective project management through activities such as
  financing of specialists and office equipment; renting of vehicles; travel costs for key program staff;
  participation in planning, review, and dissemination workshops; participation in study tours and conferences
  financing administrative costs; and the monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  At appraisal, the project was estimated at US$151.50 million, out of which US$106 million were financed by
  the World Bank through an IDA credit and US$45.50 million were borrower contributions. An additional
  financing in the amount of $400 million was approved on March 30, 2018, out of which US $200 million
  were financed by the World Bank through an IBRD credit and US$200 million were borrower contribution.

  US $20 million remained undisbursed by the end of the project. Actual project cost at closing was US $400
  million.

  The project became effective on November 26, 2012, and closed on August 20, 2022. The project
  underwent five restructurings.

   5. The fifth restructuring of October 25, 2021 changed components, costs, and the results framework.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
At the time of approval, high levels of malnutrition were a significant human development constraint – one
third of children born in India were “born with a low birth weight; by age five, 43 percent were underweight;
and almost half of all children were chronically malnourished (stunted) with a very high risk of serious
negative consequences for life” (ICR. P. 1). The project was aligned with the World Bank 2008 Country
Assistance Strategy that identified “stubbornly high levels of malnutrition (CAS, p. 19)” as one of the key
human development constraints. Enhancing service delivery through strengthened institutional
arrangements that improve the enabling environment comprised one of the key CAS pillars. The PDO to
support policy framework, systems and capacities on the supply side and mobilization of communities on
the demand side, along with creating mechanisms to facilitate multi-sectoral actions were aligned with the
CAS objective of enhancing the enabling environment. The objective was aligned with the 2018 SCD
emphasis on the policy area of “early nutrition and stimulation” (SCD, p. 64). The project continued to be
consistent with the country strategy at closing: Country Partnership Framework (FY 2018-2022) identifies
the project as a key component of the country strategy under Focus Area 3, ‘Investing in Human Capital.’

The project was also aligned with the government strategy. According to the Government of India’s
Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012), one of the key goals was the reduction of malnutrition among
children of age group 0-3. The PDO was revised in 2018 from the institutional focus to a service delivery
approach. The Government of India wanted the project to be scaled up and aligned with the new National
Nutrition Mission.

The lowering of ambition and discontinuation of the APL instrumental presented some challenges to the
relevance. At approval, the project directly aimed at impacting the enabling environment through a wide
array of activities such as human resource reforms and decentralized district planning. However, in 2015,
the ambition of the project design was scaled back, and resources were diverted to a more targeted

               approach. The CAS also put forth the APL as an effective approach “to building capacities and
               strengthening systems.” However, the APL instrument was discontinued in 2015.

               The project was aligned with the World Bank sector experience in the country. The World Bank was
               engaged in India to combat malnutrition in the 1980s through a Nutrition project in the south Indian state of
               Tamil Nadu. The engagement continued through three projects focused on the ICDS program: (i) ICDS I in
               Andhra Pradesh and Orissa; (ii) ICDS II in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh; and (iii) ICDS III in Kerala,
               Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, along with a national training component (PAD,
               11). While there were no lending initiatives after 2006, the World Bank was closely engaged with India
               through advisory and analytical assistance with the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) to
               “define the needed reforms and secure the required buy-in to reform ICDS and enable it to achieve its
               potential on nutritional outcomes” (ICR, p. 2).

               Overall, considering Bank's three-decade involvement in India’s Nutrition sector and the ICDS project's 5
               years implementation at the time of objective revision, the revised objectives fell short of the necessary
               impact alignment for significant influence on child nutritional outcomes in India. The revised PDO,
               emphasizing access and service delivery quality, fall short to build upon the previously robust systems
               strengthening approach. Additionally, the service delivery approach provides limited insights into the
               demand side, despite the initial phase strongly emphasizing its importance. According to the original theory
               of change (ICR, p. 2), the project aimed at improving child nutrition as the ultimate outcome, a facet not fully
               addressed by the service delivery orientation.

                             Objective
                             Strengthen the ICDS policy framework, systems, capacities, and community engagement

                             Rationale
                             While the ICR presents the Theory of Change (ToC) diagram, it lacks further elaboration or clarification. The
                             ICRR reconstructs the rationale behind the ToC by drawing from the ICR narrative found in the component
                             section, the project appraisal document (PAD), and the project paper.

                             The first objective of the project aimed to strengthen the ICDS system to improve child development services,
                             which comprises nutrition counselling and outreach services for the pregnant and lactating women and
                             children under the age of 3 and enhance community to ensure a greater focus on children under three years
                             of age. The ICDS program is a Government of India flagship program initiated in 1975 aimed at improving the
                             health and wellbeing of mothers and children under the age of six years through a combination of services
                             including “health and nutrition education, health services (including immunization and growth monitoring),

                                                                                                                              Page 5 of 21

supplementary food, and pre-school education, thus encompassing the troika of food, health and childcare
and development interventions” (PAD, p. 2). These services are delivered by Anganwadi workers (AWWs:
community workers) who are chosen by the community to serve the community in Anganwadi centers (rural
childcare centers).

Under the first objective, the project aimed to address both the demand and supply sides. To bolster the
supply side, focusing on fortifying the ICDS policy framework, systems, and capacities, the project outlined a
series of activities. These encompassed the review, refinement, and harmonization of ICDS policies,
guidelines, and procedures, including human resource reform. Additionally, the project sought to revise
existing management practices and tools to enhance the ICDS monitoring system, and it planned to review
and adapt training models while testing decentralized capacity-building methods. Initiatives such as piloting
the adaptation of the ICDS program for urban settings were also part of this supply-side strengthening.
Concurrently, on the demand side, the project directed efforts toward amplifying the demand for ICDS
services. Activities in this area involved refining and assessing existing behavior change communication
(BCC) practices and implementation of community-driven and evidence-based BCC strategies, spanning
media campaigns, community events, and mobilization drives. The project also planned outreach programs
targeting groups like mothers' support groups and influential figures such as tribal leaders. Finally, the project
intended to support the "interface between the supply and demand sides of the ICDS program, particularly
during the delivery of nutrition services," with meticulous monitoring and evaluation of this interface (PAD, p.
9).

After negligible performance, the project was heavily restructured in 2015. The key changes were the refocus
of project activities, change in PDO indicators, and introduction of disbursement-linked-indicators. The APL
instrument was discontinued and the refocus comprised “fewer high impact interventions” (ICR, p.7). Under
the first objective, the project directed resources towards strengthening the capacities and skills of ICDS field
functionaries and supervisory staff on the supply side. The capacity-building approach was to be executed
through an "Incremental Learning-by-doing approach." Second, the project invested in technology tools,
including mobile and tablet-based ICT tools, to enhance management, monitoring, and beneficiary outreach.
These tools facilitated consistent real-time reporting and monitoring of service delivery at AWCs. On the
demand side, the project focused on (i) an intensive mass media campaign on maternal, infant, and young
child nutrition and (ii) the organization and institutionalization of monthly community-based events at the
AWCs.

While lower in ambition following the restructuring, the theory of change for the first objective was clear and
convincing. An incremental learning approach to strengthen the capacity of the ICDS functionaries along with
a fortified management and monitoring system on the supply side and an intensive media campaign and
institutionalized community-based events on the demand side could reasonably be expected to strengthen
the ICDS policy framework, systems, capacities, and community engagement.

The key assumption of the first objective is that the listed project activities will strengthen policy frameworks,
systems, capacities, and community engagement, which will thereby improve the quality, coverage, and
utilization of the ICDS services. At the time of project approval, the ICDS was failing in meeting its goals and
eradicating malnutrition in children. Evaluation work by the Government of India and the World Bank pointed
out some reasons of the inadequacy of the ICDS efficacy. These reasons included (i) an overemphasis on
food-based interventions at the cost of other important prerequisites such as utilization of health services,
sanitation, and appropriate child feeding and caring practices (ii) low capacity of implementation agencies (iii)
weak stewardship and funding. Moreover, in practice, ICDS largely focused on children between aged 3 and
6, which left out the critical first 1000 days of life. The capacity building activities, management and monitoring

system, and community-based events to focus on the early years can reasonably be expected to address the
listed shortcomings.

Intermediate Indicators

388,542 health personnel received training, exceeding the target of 280,000

62 percentage of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) in project districts implemented monthly community-based
processes focused on nutrition and health counselling (at least 5 events in the past 6 months), falling short of
the target of 80 percent.

Outcomes

100 percent project districts implemented the “incremental capacity building” program, exceeding the target of
80 percent.

60 percent of targeted AWCs reported key nutrition and service delivery indicators using ICT systems every
month for the last 3 months, meeting the target of 60 percent.

The PDO indicators were insufficient for measuring the broader outcome of strengthened “ICDS policy
framework, systems, capacities, and community engagement " For instance, the first two indicators report on
the existence of ICDS management information system and if the incremental capacity building is
implemented. However, the indicators do not offer insights into the effectiveness of the training program or
the MIS's contribution to reinforcing the policy framework, systems, and capacities. The Disbursement-linked
indicators provide additional evidence to substantiate the PDOs.

Additional evidence comes from Disbursement Linked Indicators. For the first DLI to be achieved, several
indicators had to be accomplished: Standardized operating procedures /specifications for ICT monitoring and
service management system issued by MWCD (DLI.1.1), Contracts for ICT hardware and supporting
consulting services signed by each Participating State in accordance with guidelines set forth in the
Operations Manual (DLI 1.2), At least 70 percent of AWWs in Project Districts in each Participating State
trained in the ICT-based management, monitoring and communication system in accordance with the
Training Plan (DLI. 1.3), National workshop held by MWCD on state nutrition and ICDS Program reporting
using ICT (DLI. 1.4). All states achieved the DLIs, except Uttar Pradesh that did not achieve DLI 1.2.

Similarly, for the second DLI to be achieved, the following actions were completed: At least 60 percent of
District Resource Groups and 60 percent of Block Resource Groups in Project Districts in each Participating
State are trained in 3 thematic modules for incremental learning (DLI 2. 1), At least 80 percent of DRG in
Project Districts in each Participating State are trained in another 3 thematic modules for incremental learning
over Year (DLI 2. 2), 10 thematic training modules for incremental learning developed in accordance with the
Communications Plan (DLI 2.3). All states achieved DLI 2.

For the third DLI to be achieved, the following measures were implemented: In all states, 80 percent of AWCs

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Strengthen convergent action for improved nutrition outcomes

Rationale
The second objective aimed to strengthen convergent actions to improve nutrition outcomes. While the ICR
presents the Theory of Change (ToC) diagram, it lacks further elaboration or clarification. The ICRR
reconstructs the rationale behind the ToC by drawing from the ICR narrative found in the component section,
the project appraisal document (PAD), and the project paper.

To bolster convergent actions for improved nutrition outcomes, a series of comprehensive interventions were
planned. These interventions encompassed the development of conceptual frameworks, the reinforcement of
national and regional planning and coordination structures, the pilot testing of multi-sectoral convergent
actions, and the establishment of an evidence base for such actions. The project's aim was to strengthen both
central and state-level structures for planning, coordinating, and monitoring nutrition-related initiatives across
sectors, which included the creation of an inter-sectoral nutrition action coordination committee, designed to
engage stakeholders in discussions about potential structural adjustments in policies and procedures to
facilitate cohesive actions. Finally, the project aimed to evaluate and conduct research to substantiate the
effectiveness of convergent nutrition actions in India.

After a negligible initial performance, the project was heavily restructured in 2015. Under objective 2, the
testing of pilots and nutritional action plans were prioritized. Additionally, the project provided flexibility to
states to design and implement nutrition action plans as per their need and priority, while the MWCD (the
central implementing agency) ensured that the pilots proposed by the state were within the purview of
project’s development objectives.

The key assumption underlying Objective 1 was that addressing nutrition outcomes requires collaborative
efforts across multiple sectors. The PAD substantiates this by drawing on past project experiences and
highlighting how various determinants influence nutrition outcomes (p. 34). These determinants encompass
activities related to food and nutrient intake, healthcare, maternal and child feeding practices, hygiene, water,
sanitation, and considerations of gender, equity, and governance. Another important assumption was that
strengthening of institutional norms through activities such as developing of conceptual frameworks and
reinforcing planning and coordination structures would facilitate convergent actions. The PAD draws on
evidence from other World Bank projects, such as the World Bank Bachpan project in India and a nutrition
project in Bangladesh, to demonstrate the effectiveness of these initiatives in promoting convergent actions.
However, the assumption neglects to account for administrative and bureaucratic complexities, which indeed
hindered the implementation of these reforms. The ICR acknowledges that during the initial phase,
bureaucratic obstacles posed significant challenges (p. 22).

Intermediate Outcome

• National menu of options for convergent nutrition action pilots/studies for project states were prepared and
discussed in a consultative workshop by the Central Project Management Unit (CPMU).

• Annual Learning events organized were organized

• 89.50 percent of project districts operationalized convergent nutrition action plans among those that
developed them in the past year against a target of 60 percent

Outcome

District convergence committees in seven states developed convergent nutrition action plans, exceeding the
target of six states.

Additional evidence comes from the disbursement-linked indicators. For the fourth DLI to be achieved, the
following activities were accomplished: (i) DLI 4.1. List of priority innovation areas and pilots eligible to be
implemented under Part C of the Project agreed between MWCD and all Participating States and approved
by the Association and (ii) DLI 4.2. At least one pilot designed by each Participating State to be implemented
under Part C of the Project approved by MWCD.

The expected outcome was the improved alignment of sector services, quantified by the PDO indicator
"Number of project states in which convergent nutrition action plans have been developed by the district
convergence committees in at least one district." The PDO indicator falls short in capturing the broader
outcome of "strengthened convergent actions for improved nutrition outcomes." The indicator focuses on the
development of action plans, without offering evidence of their effectiveness or their role in bolstering
convergent actions for improved nutrition.

Considering the partial achievement of DLIs and the PDO indicator, this ICRR rates the objective as Modest.

OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
Improve the coverage of ICDS nutrition services
(New objective)

Rationale
For the additional financing (AF), there was a shift from “a process and capacity building focus to a service
delivery focus” (ICR, p. 7). The AF expanded the intended coverage from 162 high burden districts across 8
states to 315 districts (out of the 766 total districts) across all states/UTs of India. The additional financing
comprised the first phase of roll out of the National Nutrition Mission of the government of India.

The ICR does not present the ToC for the revised objectives. The ICRR reconstructs the ToC rationale using
the ICR narrative in the component section and the project paper.

The theory of change for the additional financing was clear and logical. The project continued to support the
activities under the previous phases, while scaling them up to additional districts. These activities included the
incremental learning approach for capacity building; community engagement and behavior change
communication activities (specifically, CBEs, mass and mid-media campaigns); and the ICT-based
management and monitoring tool. Additional initiatives under the additional financing included “the
strengthening of existing citizen engagement and grievance redress systems to improve community
engagement, the introduction of performance-based incentives to ICDS field functionaries and project states
for improving service delivery, and the development and operationalization of convergent action plans (CAPs)
for nutrition at the state, district, and block levels” (Project paper, p. 11).

388,541 health personnel received training, exceeding the target of 280,000

99.8 percent of targeted AWCs reporting using POSHAN Tracker every month for the last 6 months,
exceeding the target of 60 percent

903,027 ICDS personnel received training on POSHAN Tracker, exceeding the target of 560,000

37 percent project states had at least one mid-media campaign deployed in the past year, exceeding the

61 percent of AWCs in project districts implemented at least 4 CBEs focusing on agreed MIYCN themes in
the last 6 months, almost meeting the target of 65 percent.

11 percent of CBEs implemented in project districts in the last 6 months that focus on community influencers,
almost meeting the target of 15 percent.

85.68 percent of Block Resource Groups (BRGs) and sectors conducted at least four monthly learning and
review meetings on nutrition knowledge and services in the last six months, exceeding the target of 60
percent.

Outcomes

60,594 pregnant/lactating women (PLW) and children under 3 years in project districts were reached by the
ICDS services, almost meeting the target of 64,000

12,099 children under 3 years in project district were reached by the ICDS services, exceeding the target of
8,700

The ICR also presents supplementary evidence in the efficiency section. Stunting rates showed more rapid
improvement across the 11 priority states targeted by the project in comparison to the non-priority states.
Within the priority states, the stunting rate decreased by 4 percentage points, contrasting with the 0.04
percentage point reduction in the non-priority states. Although not establishing causation, since multiple
factors might contribute to these outcomes, especially considering that slower-performing states have the

potential for quicker growth, the ICR notes a higher utilization of ICDS services in priority states – 76.3
percent to 63.2 percent, as opposed to non-priority states – 72.3 percent to 66.5 percent.

Additional evidence came from the DLIs. The project tracked the DLIs under Objective 1 and Objective 2.
Considering the achievement of DLIs and the two PDO indicators, this ICRR rates the objective as

 5. Efficiency
The PAD noted that a rate of return analysis for the project was deemed inappropriate by a leading team of
Human Development economists. The recommendation was to focus on “why the institutional reforms and
capacity development that are proposed in the project are critical to improving service delivery” (PAD, p. 15).
Consequently, the PAD stated that the project was designed to improve allocative efficiency by promoting
interventions focusing on children 0-3 years of age, the first 1000 years that are intended to produce the most
important outcomes. Following the PAD, the ICR focuses on allocative and technical efficiency. The ICR
mentions that the original and restructured project enabled the additional financing investments to be directed to
the interventions that were evidence-based and demonstrated results. For instance, the project “incentivized the
setup of convergence platforms where different ministries and departments that implement interventions
impacting nutrition outcomes, came together to achieve a synergy of nutrition interventions to target
undernutrition” (ICR, p.18). The ICR also reported that the project’s support to MWCD enabled the ministry to
increase its resource envelop and sustain project activities – the national nutrition mission, as a share of the
ICDS program increased from 8 percent to 15 percent between 2017-2018 to 2020-2021.

The ICR reports a $5 per person per year cost of the project but does not provide any evidence on the efficiency
aspect of this amount, i.e., if this amount is comparable to other nutrition projects. The original project 2012-
2015 faced several implementation challenges, with only 6 percent of amount being disbursed. There was a
significant lack of activity (ICR, p. 23). The complexity of the project design, limited capacity of the
implementation agency, and bureaucratic hurdles were major impediments to implementation. While the project
assessed capacity risk as high, the mitigation measures were clearly inadequate. The restructuring helped
improve the pace of the project by re-focusing the project on fewer but high impact interventions, introducing the
disbursement-linked-indicators, and replacing the technical agency with a Bank executed Multi donor Trust Fund
that provided “high quality technical assistance” (p. 6). Yet, 7.3 percent of the funds remained undisbursed due
to delayed disbursement in the second half of AF due to CoVid and shift in the monitoring tool. Despite nudging
by the World Bank, the undisbursed amount was not cancelled and returned. During the implementation period,
there was large variability in implementation and performance among the states, and the transition from the
project monitoring tool to a government tool of tracking resulted in a lack of data availability for substantial
periods of time.

6. Outcome

Relevance of project objectives is rated Substantial throughout the project duration, as the objectives were
mostly aligned at project closing with the Bank's Country Partnership Framework for India (FY 2018-2022) and
the government's policy efforts and reforms. Efficiency is rated as Modest based on the allocative and technical
efficiency of the project. The implementation delays and the undisbursed amount under additional financing
impacted the project's efficiency.

Original Project – Moderately Satisfactory

Efficacy is rated Substantial, as the project almost fully achieved its original development objectives to
Strengthen the ICDS policy framework, systems, capacities, and partially achieved community engagement to
ensure greater focus on children under three years of age; and Strengthen convergent action for improved
nutrition outcomes. The outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory because there was modest achievement of
one objective used in the assessment of efficacy.

Project after Revision – Moderately Satisfactory

Efficacy is rated Substantial, as the two new objectives to improve the coverage and quality of ICDS nutrition
services to pregnant and lactating women and children under 3 years of age were almost fully achieved.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The ICR assessment assigned a Low risk rating to development due to the following reasons:

a) High Government Commitment: The ICR underscores the commitment exhibited by both central and
state governments, with example of this commitment being institutionalization of project activities. These
activities encompass a range of actions, such as prioritized home visits, integration of training modules for
ICDS functionaries and supervisors into the ministry's training curriculum, and the establishment of a regular
practice of performance-based incentives. Moreover, the notable adoption of the incremental learning
approach by the Government of India's Capacity Building Commission across all administrative echelons
further reinforces this high level of commitment.

b) Continuation of Project Interventions: The project's impact extends beyond its duration through the
preservation of the enhanced capacities and systems fostered under its purview. Noteworthy among these is
the Poshan Tracker, an instrument dedicated to monitoring nutrition outcomes, and the effective grievance
mechanisms. Both of these will endure beyond the project's timeline.

Overall, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the high government commitment and continuation of
project interventions will sustain outside of the project.

  The project was aligned with the World Bank 2008 Country Assistance Strategy. One of the key pillars of
  CAS included improved service delivery India through enhanced enabling environment. The project
  development objective to support policy framework, systems and capacities on the supply side and
  mobilization of communities on the demand side, along with creating mechanisms to facilitate multi-
  sectoral actions were precisely aligned with the CAS objective of enhancing the enabling environment.
  The project included an equity plan to ensure that the project equally benefitted the tribal communities,
  low caste population, and religious minority. The project drew on existing evidence from the World Bank
  experience and other large scale nutrition programs to inform project design.

  The project used a technical assistance agency to provide technical support to country project
  management units and state project management units. The PAD highlighted that the procurement of the
  technical assistance agency was a critical factor for the success of the project. However, the capacity of
  the technical agency was not assessed adequately. The TA agency had to be replaced by qualified
  consultants at the state and central level under the Multi-donor trust fund. The procurement for the project
  was planned as per World Bank Group guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and Non-Consulting
  Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits & Grants by World Bank Borrowers (PAD, p. 40). The
  project relied on country systems for the audit process and the fiduciary implementation arrangement
  required states to make a two-fold submission that proved complex (ICR, p. 26).

  The project’s quality at entry suffered from underestimation of risks commensurate to the complexity of
  project design. The ICR stated that the “weakness was appropriately highlighted as a high risk; however,
  mitigation measures were insufficient according to the ICR (p. 22) and mitigation impacts were
  overestimated in terms of time” (p. 27). The underestimation was evident from the underperformance of
  the project before the restructuring. During the 2012-2015, only 6 percent of the project funds were
  disbursed. At entry, project implementation arrangements did not consider the time and resources
  required to reform human resources (ICR, p. 22). The ICR also noted the complexity of the project
  design, which was “trying to right every wrong documented (ICR, p. 22).”



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 Project supervision remained consistent, adapting even during COVID lockdowns, utilizing virtual platforms
 for field visits. In the initial years of the Original Project, teams ensured regular supervision. Despite
 determined efforts and increased hands-on support, bureaucratic challenges persisted. Inadequate
 mitigation strategies, combined with disappointing Technical Agency performance, resulted in
 implementation coming to a halt. The 2015 restructuring marked a pivotal reinitiating. The
 restructuring identified "the main implementation hurdles, and proposed a highly effective new approach
 and a critical change to the TA provision to the MWCD and the States" (p. 27). The revised approach
 simplified the ambitious plan, concentrating on evidence-based interventions and employing existing
 government structures for delivery. High-quality Technical Assistance (TA) was ensured through the MDTF,
 remedying earlier shortcomings. Shifting from traditional input-based financing to results-based financing
 via new Disbursement-Linked Indicators (DLIs) at central and state levels promoted accountability. Joint
 implementation review missions with government, WB, and MDTF donors were successful, enhancing

 emerged as a valuable practice.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 In the original project phase, clearly defined objectives lacked appropriate indicators, hindering the
 measurement of broader outcomes. For example, while the PDO indicators for the first objective report on
 the existence of ICDS management information system and if the incremental capacity building is
 implemented, the indicators provide no information on if and how the ICDS management information
 system and the incremental capacity building program contributed to the strengthening of the policy
 framework, systems, and capacities. These shortcomings were partly addressed by the disbursement-
 linked indicators. In the revised phase, the PDOs were appropriate for measuring the service-delivery
 outcomes of the additional financing. Moreover, the original M&E framework of the project supported the
 ongoing reforms of the national ICDS program, which supported simplifying data collection, validation,
 monitoring, and evaluation.



b. M&E Implementation
  Throughout the implementation, a significant focus was placed on the ICDS-CAS system and
  subsequently the Poshan tracker. These systems ensured consistent data collection and the timely
  application of this data for informed decision-making. The implementation faced several constraints
  during the initial phase. The development and testing of the IT system took place only under the
  Restructured Project, with its implementation expanding to cover all States. This continued under
  Additional Financing (AF) and was eventually replaced by the Poshan Tracker in early 2021, as per a
  government decision. However, this transition led to two significant disruptions: one due to the shift to the
  Poshan Tracker and another caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of the Poshan Tracker
  notably boosted the sustainability of the monitoring systems. This was attributed to the fact that the
  government owned and oversaw its implementation (as mentioned in the TTL Interview, July 20, 2023).



c. M&E Utilization
  The IT platform greatly facilitated prompt M&E, eased beneficiary data recording, and tracked child
  growth. It served as both a job tool and a time-saving aid for AWWs, enhancing service quality. ICDS
  supervisors benefited from improved supervision, course correction, and data analysis. The system
  empowered AWWs to stick to plans, prioritize needy families, and better allocate time between tasks.

                                                                                                    Page 17 of 21

  Clear and measurable indicators were employed for Communication for Social and Behavioral Change.
  The project set realistic targets after revising ambitious ones, aligning with CBEs and outreach visits by
  trained AWWs to encourage positive feeding practices. Verification methods validated AWW and CBE
  field conduct. Findings from the POSHAN Knowledge and Behavior survey informed recommendations,
  emphasizing improved nutrition behaviors through robust service delivery. Leveraging the MDTF,
  research and evaluation flourished. Insights from systematic assessments, interviews, and surveys
  shaped interventions and innovations, enhancing overall project effectiveness.



  M&E Quality Rating

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The project was classified as a Category C project because of the lack of risks related to infrastructure
   work. No environmental assessment was undertaken under the project. No other safeguards were triggered
   (PAD, p. 20). The project prepared an equity plan covering disadvantaged communities including tribal
   population, Scheduled castes, and religious minorities, to "guide the project in ensuring it responds to the
   special needs of these underserved populations" (PAD, p. 20).




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   While the project’s financial management was rated as "Moderately Satisfactory" for most of the project, it
   dipped to "Moderately Unsatisfactory" in February 2022. This downgrade was due to delays in submitting
   and auditing financial reports. The project relied on the country's audit system instead of having its own.
   For the project's success, specific states needed to submit two reports: one detailing their spending
   (Eligible Expenditure Program) and another from the Auditor General. This became complex as not all
   states met the timeline. Additionally, COVID-19 led to extended submission times for reports in 2019-20
   and 2020-21, alleviating some pressure. A state's delay caused a rating drop, but eventually, all required
   reports were submitted, restoring the financial management rating to "Moderately Satisfactory" upon
   project completion.

12. Lessons

Employing specific and clear incentives can serve as important motivators to achieving
results. The project's transition from input-driven funding to disbursement-linked
indicators effectively enhanced state involvement to achieve outcomes. Similarly, offering incentives
to ICDS field functionaries for enhancing their performance, including timely home visits and
organizing community events, emerged as appropriate motivational tools, driving tangible results.

Harmonized donor coordination can enhance efficacy and efficiency. The Multi-donor Trust
fund mechanism, established in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF),
Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), and Tata Foundation, played a pivotal role in course
correction by offering valuable technical assistance. The harmonized donor coordination through a
single trust fund proved effective in aligning efforts under a unified thematic framework and
optimizing resource utilization.

Leveraging technology can bolster accountability and efficiency. Through project
implementation, the project demonstrated use of technology solutions like the ICDS-CAS and
subsequently, the Poshan Tracker. These mobile technologies demonstrated notable advantages
such as substantial time savings for field workers, quality of service delivery, and the capacity to
track outcomes in real time. By capitalizing on these innovations, the program demonstrated how
technology integration can significantly enhance operational effectiveness and provide an accurate
and up-to-date account of progress.

An incremental and institutionalized approach to capacity building ensures effectiveness and
sustainability. The incremental learning approach, as executed in the program, encompassed
identifying issues, devising locally viable solutions, and gradually applying this knowledge in a
phased manner. This involved addressing challenges faced by functionaries in prior training rounds
and implementing solutions in the subsequent month's practices. The strategy focused on
progressively building upon small increments of learning, gradually integrating all skills,




                                                                                                    Page 19 of 21

comprehension, and actions into regular practice, and ensuring full internalization by the
functionaries.

Incorporating project interventions into national systems fosters long-term
sustainability. Project initiatives such as the incentives-based payments were adopted as routine
practice in the ICDS program. Similarly, the grievance redressal system will continue beyond the
project. For instance, the grievance redress mechanism established as a helpline in Gujarat has
evolved into a two-way system, enhancing accountability between various tiers and empowering
beneficiaries by providing them a platform for voicing their concerns. Lessons learned from the
project were integrated into the Government approach to combat malnutrition.

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR provided a comprehensive overview of the project. It was candid and reasonably concise. Its outcome
orientation was at an intermediate level, but related moderate gaps were rooted in the initial M&E design rather
than the ICR itself. The project underwent substantial restructuring on two occasions, and these transitions
were effectively discussed and the changes to the PDO indicators were distilled into tables with clarity. By
drawing on the implementation experience, the ICR successfully gathered evidence and openly acknowledged
the deficiencies and limitations encountered during the initial phase of the project. It offered several important
lessons derived from project experience. The ICR exhibited some shortcomings. The split rating table ought to
have been grounded in objective-specific ratings, evaluating the accomplishment of the original objectives
throughout the project's entire lifespan, until their revision/drop in 2018. Additionally, the ICR failed to present a
satisfactory explanation of the theory of change, which the ICRR reconstructs by drawing from the ICR
narrative found in the component section, the project appraisal document (PAD), and the project paper.
