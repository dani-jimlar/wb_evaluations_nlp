2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The original Program Development Objective (PDO) of this programmatic series of operations in the Program
Document (PD) for the first operation (P173424) was to “sustain access to critical infrastructure services for
firms and households following the COVID-19 crisis, while establishing the policy foundations for
recovery through sustainable and resilient infrastructure” (PD 2020, para 13).

The PDO was revised at appraisal of the second operation (P175126) to “support the Government of
Colombia's multiyear efforts to sustain access to critical infrastructure services for firms and households
following the COVID-19 crisis, while establishing the policy foundations for recovery through sustainable
and resilient infrastructure” (PD 2021, para 39).

For the purpose of this ICR Review, the individual objectives to be assessed are as follows:

Objective 1. Support the Government of Colombia's multiyear efforts to sustain access to critical infrastructure
services for firms and households following the COVID-19 crisis.

Objective 2. Establish the policy foundations for recovery through sustainable and resilient infrastructure.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas




                                                                                                      Page 2 of 22

     Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructure (P173424)



The program consisted of four pillars, of which the third one was added in the second operation (PD 2021, para
39).

Pillar 1. Sustaining Access to Critical Infrastructure to Secure the Economy from COVID-19.

Pillar 2. Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructure for Recovery from COVID-19.

Pillar 3. Increased Access to Digital Infrastructure for Recovery from COVID-19.

Pillar 4. Sound Fiscal Management and Long-Term Infrastructure Finance for Recovery from COVID-19.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

Program Cost. The program’s cost was US$1.25 billion at appraisal and at closing.

Financing. Two IBRD loans of US$500 million and US$750 million financed the program. The total loan
amount was fully disbursed on completion and verification of prior actions.

Dates. The first operation was approved on September 30, 2020, became effective on March 12, 2021, and
closed as scheduled on March 31, 2022. The second operation was approved on May 17, 2021, became
effective on June 10, 2021, and closed as scheduled on June 30, 2022.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Country Context. After two decades of consistent economic growth and reduction in poverty, the COVID-19
 crisis reversed progress in social improvements and caused the first recession in 20 years and the worst in
 more than a century, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020 contracting 6.8 percent.
 Unemployment rose from 12.2 percent in February 2020 to 21.4 percent in May 2020, and poverty increased
 by around 6.7 percentage points between 2019 and 2020 (ICR, para 2). Colombia’s initial COVID-19
 emergency response package aimed to ensure continued access to infrastructure services by postponing the
 payment of infrastructure services during the crisis. As a result, service providers faced cash flow problems
 that would prevent them from providing the services. To address this challenge, subnational entities provided
 operational subsidies to the service providers which would demand close to 1.8 times the subsidy needs pre-
 COVID-19. Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis increased the reliance of households and firms on digital
 communications and transactions.

 Relevance to Government Strategies. The PDO was in line with the government’s following policies and
 strategies. The government had the “Policy for Economic Reactivation and Sustainable and Inclusive
 Growth,” approved in February 2021 as National Economic and Social Policy Council (CONPES) document
 4023. This CONPES approved a set of policies and investment programs to restore the economy to its pre-
 COVID-19 growth path in the short term while transitioning to more sustainable, resilient growth in the long
 term. The policies and programs aimed to accelerate the structural transition of the energy and transport
 sectors and induce long-term and private financing for infrastructure services. Pillars 1, 2, and 4 supported
 the policies and programs. Furthermore, the country’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 22

digital transformation strategy was laid out in the National Development Plan issued through Law 1955 of
May 25, 2019, the ICT Plan 2018 – 2022, and the strategic plans of the National Spectrum Agency and the
Communications Regulatory Commission. The government had the ICT Sector Modernization Law (Law
1978, July 25, 2019) that pillar 3 supported.

Relevance to Bank Assistance Strategies. The objectives were relevant to address a main obstacle to
inclusive and sustainable growth identified in the Systematic Country Diagnostics (table V-1, page 111), that
was an investment gap in physical infrastructure, especially transport, partially due to institutional constraints.
The PDOs were aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY2016-2021. The program
aimed to support the CPF’s Pillar 1 (Fostering Balanced Territorial Development) and Pillar 3 (Supporting
Fiscal Sustainability and Productivity). Specifically, the program supported the CPF’s objective 1,
Strengthened Public Management Capacity to Support Territorial Development, through enhanced
infrastructure for roads and electricity. The program also supported the CPF’s objective 8, Improved
Infrastructure Services and Enhanced Urban Planning to Develop Competitive Cities, through strengthening
mass-transit systems. Moreover, the DPF series supported Colombia’s broad program of critical initial
emergency measures in the immediate aftermath of COVID-19, in line with the World Bank Group COVID-19
Crisis Response Approach Paper discussed by the Board on June 25, 2020 (ICR, para 12).


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

Objective 1. Support the Government of Colombia's multiyear efforts to sustain access to critical
infrastructure services for firms and households following the COVID-19 crisis.

Pillar 1. Sustaining Access to Critical Infrastructure to Secure the Economy from COVID-19.

      PAs 1-3. Targeted and temporary support to utilities and PPPs facing financial strain from declining
       demand and payment deferrals.

During the COVID-19 crisis, the government introduced payment deferrals for electricity and water supply
and sanitation services, which benefitted low-income households (i.e., socio-economic strata 1 and 2) who
spent a high proportion of their income on user fees for basic services. However, the payment deferrals on
utilities were expected to result in increasing subsidies, putting at risk the financial sustainability of utilities.
Moreover, the public transport systems transported fewer people and increased labor and maintenance costs
due to safety and sanitation protocols. Furthermore, the lockdown reduced the revenues for the toll roads that
were constructed through the Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and concession contracts.

PA 1 supported the decision of providing liquidity to utilities to maintain their operational solvency through a
concessional liquidity line of credit from FINDETER. PA 2 aimed at supporting municipalities operating public
transport systems by enabling the amendment of concession contracts between municipalities and transport
service operators and authorizing the national government to temporarily support operating costs. PA 3
aimed to allow extending infrastructure concessions beyond the limits established under each regulatory
framework. The PAs were grounded in credible analytical work at the country level, which included the Impact
Assessments of COVID-19 pandemic on Colombia’s Energy and Transport Sectors by the World Bank (2020,
ongoing at appraisal) that presented analyses of the liquidity needs in the power, water, and transport sectors
in the short and long term. The PAs made a major contribution to the achievement of the objective 1, by

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 22

addressing constraints for the following: the service provider’s financial sustainability (PA 1), the national
government’s financial support to the transport services in municipalities (PA 2), and the regulatory
framework to infrastructure concessions (PA 3). Thus, the relevance of the PAs is rated satisfactory.

Objective 2. Establish the policy foundations for recovery through sustainable and resilient
infrastructure.

Pillar 2. Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructure for Recovery from COVID-19.

      PAs 4-8. Clean energy as a driver of the COVID-19 recovery.

The National Energy Plan of 2015 set an ambitious target for the increase in Non-Conventional Renewable
Energy (NCRE) generation. The challenges regarding the clean energy generation include the lack of
incentives and storage systems and gender inequality in the sector. First, the short-term energy contracts
(i.e., 2-3 years), which were the norm in the Colombian power market, did not provide the required incentives
for developing renewable energy projects that would require long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)
to achieve bankability. Second, the Generation and Transmission Expansion Plan 2015-2029 identified the
need for energy storage systems as an efficient mechanism to ensure reliable electricity supply in congested
areas where significant delays were anticipated in the construction of distribution and transmission lines
across the country. Third, gender gaps in the Colombian labor market, sexual harassments in workplaces,
and limited participation of the enterprises owned and managed by women were issues in the energy sector.

PA 4 aimed to establish the first ever auction mechanism to award long-term clean energy contracts at
competitive prices while attracting new investors to the sector. PA 5 aimed to update the National Determined
Contribution (NDC) to expand the NCRE generation, the policy and legal framework on clean energy
transition in the transport sector, and the carbon pricing instruments. PA 6 aimed to establish the rules for the
installation of the storage system. PA 7 aimed to develop the policy and legal framework to enhance the
NCRE investments in non-interconnected areas. PA 8 aimed to support the MME to obtain the gender
certification called “Sello Equipares” to reduce gender inequality in the energy sector. The PAs were
grounded in credible analytical work at the country level, which included How to successfully design auctions
to procure non-conventional renewable energy and increase competition: the Colombia case (Draft) by the
World Bank (2020); Report pillar 5 of Mission of Transformation of the Energy Sector: Revision of the legal
and institutional framework by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) (2020); and Update and
Consolidation of Reference and Mitigation Scenarios of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by the World Bank
(2020) (PD 2020, table 6, page 50; PD 2021, table 8, pages 44-45). PAs 4-7 would be expected to make a
major contribution to the achievement of the relevant PDO; thus, the relevance of the PAs is
satisfactory. Regarding PA 8, the results chain linking the PA to achievement of the PDO was only partly
convincing. While supporting female workers and women-owned businesses in the energy sector would be
important for its sustainability, the results chain did not explicitly explain how obtaining the gender certification
would contribute to establishing the policy foundation for the recovery through the sustainable and resilient
infrastructure. Thus, the relevance of PA 8 is moderately satisfactory.

      PAs 9-14. Multimodal transport, sustainable logistics and urban transport as a driver of the COVID-19
       recovery.

The country’s high reliance on the gasoline-powered vehicles (e.g., trucks) in transport and logistics led to the
increased motorization and the proliferation of informal modes, resulting in increased congestion, road traffic
accidents, and GHG and local pollutant emissions. To address the problem, modern multimodal transport

                                                                                                        Page 5 of 22

would be needed but it was virtually non-existent in Colombia at appraisal. In addition, public and private
investments in the transport and logistics sector did not pay sufficient attention to the complementarity of
transport modes and to mechanisms for strengthening logistics services and facilitating trade, reducing the
sector’s inefficiency, and enhancing its potential for growth.

PA 9 aimed to improve the efficiency in logistics by updating the national logistics policy and guidelines and
promoting investments in multimodal infrastructure (e.g., rails, ports, and airports). PAs 10-11 aimed to
enhance private sector participation and concessions to build multimodal infrastructure by establishing policy
guidelines and criteria for the PPP financial structuring. PA 12 aimed to increase the use of electric vehicles
by setting targets for the public vehicles, reducing taxes for private electric vehicles, and building charging
stations. PAs 13-14 aimed to improve financial sustainability of the urban public transport system by
strengthening co-financing of the municipally run public transportation systems.

The PAs were based on analytical underpinning including the National Logistics Surveys (2008, 2015, 2018)
that aimed to analyze the performance and quality of logistics services for companies in Colombia; the World
Bank’s Sustainable and Competitive Programmatic ASA; and the World Bank’s technical assistance for the
design of a clean bus fund at the national level (PD 2020, table 6, page 51). Thus, the relevance of the PAs is
satisfactory.

Pillar 3. Increased Access to Digital Infrastructure for Recovery from COVID-19.

      PAs 15-17. Increased Access to Digital Infrastructure for Recovery from COVID-19.

Rural areas have little access to internet and few people there adopt it. Factors that make such access
difficult are low rural incomes, mountainous terrain, great geographical diversity, and sparsely populated
regions that make it costly to provide the service.

PAs 15-17 aimed to improve the financial viability of the service by simplifying bureaucratic procedures for
providing the service and permitting in-kind payments from operators of networks and telecommunication
services for the right to use the spectrum. These PAs were based on analytical underpinning including OECD
Report: Reviews of Digital Transformation: Going Digital in Colombia (2019); and the World Bank’s technical
assistance to the Ministry of ICT (MINTIC) to identify key policy recommendations and actions towards
improving broadband access and closing the digital divide (PD 2021, table 8, page 46). The relevance of the
PAs is satisfactory.

Pillar 4. Sound Fiscal Management and Long-Term Infrastructure Finance for Recovery from COVID-
19.

      PAs 18-19. Improving the contingent liability and PPP framework across infrastructure sectors as
       a measure to increase fiscal resilience to crises.

The management of contingent liabilities from PPPs and concessions faced challenges including the old risk
evaluation methodologies and the limited technical capacities for assessing and monitoring the contingent
liabilities, reducing the effectiveness of the contingency fund.

PAs 18-19 aimed to support improving the contingent liability and PPP framework across infrastructure
sectors by revising the risk evaluation methodologies and providing training to the stakeholders. These PAs
were based on analytical underpinning including: the World Bank’s a long-term technical assistance


                                                                                                   Page 6 of 22

engagement through the Government Debt and Risk Management Program and the Capital Markets
Strengthening Facility program (P167816). Thus, the relevance of the PAs is satisfactory.

      PAs 20-21. Leveraging private and long-term financing for infrastructure development.

The government launched the fifth-generation infrastructure investments (5G) program promoting
connectivity infrastructure, including toll roads, railways, airports, and fluvial infrastructure. However, the risk
allocation framework under the existing PPP framework was not adequate to attract alternative sources of
funding.

PAs 20-21 aimed to support leveraging private long-term financing for infrastructure development by
improving risk management. The PAs were based on analytical underpinning including: the report of the
commission of experts on transport infrastructure (2019) requested by the Vice-presidency (PD 2020, table 6,
page 51; PD 2021, table 8, page 47). The PAs would make a major contribution to the achievement of the
relevant PDO. Thus, the relevance of the PAs is satisfactory.

Of the 21 PAs, 20 were rated satisfactory (score: 5) and 1 was rated moderately satisfactory (score: 4),
leading to a total average rating of 4.95, and an overall relevance of indicators rating of satisfactory.

Prior Action (PA) 1. The Republic of Colombia has established a
concessional liquidity line of credit through the Territorial
Development Bank (FINDETER: Financiera de Desarrollo
Territorial S.A.) for public service companies, including in the
electricity and water and sanitation sectors, through December
31, 2020, to mitigate the financial impact caused by targeted tariff
deferrals directly linked to COVID-19, as authorized by Legislative
Decree No. 581 dated April 15, 2020 and published in the Official
Gazette on April 15, 2020 and in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in FINDETER's website at

4. Relevance of Results Indicators

Rationale

Objective 1. Support the Government of Colombia's multiyear efforts to sustain access to critical
infrastructure services for firms and households following the COVID-19 crisis.

      Results Indicator (RI) 1. Colombian pesos disbursed to electricity and water utilities through the
       FINDETER credit line.




                                                                                                     Page 11 of 22

RI 1 partially measured the impact of PA 1 on progress toward achievement of the objective. The indicator did
not measure for how long firms and households would have access to electricity and water. The indicator was
measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 1 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 2. Number of mass transit systems using funding and financing instruments to cover operational
       deficits generated by the impacts of COVID-19.

RI 2 partially measured the impact of PA 2 on progress toward achievement of the objective. The indicator did
not measure for how long firms and households would have access to mass transit systems. The indicator was
measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 2 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 3. Percentage of concession and PPP road contracts active prior to the COVID-19 Emergency (in
       operation or under construction) affected by the measures taken by the Declaration of the National
       Emergency that have maintained or recovered their financial balance.

RI 3 partially measured the impact of PA 3 on progress toward achievement of the objective. The indicator did
not measure for how long firms and households would have access to roads built by concession and through
PPP contracts. The indicator was measurable and the information verifiable. The relevance of RI 3 is
moderately satisfactory.

Objective 2. Establish the policy foundations for recovery through sustainable and resilient
infrastructure.

      RI 4. MW [megawatts] of NCRE awarded under the October 2019 long-term energy auction.

RI 4 did not measure progress towards the impact of the PA 4 and towards the achievement of the objective.
The RI set October 2019 as the target date for achieving the result, but this was before appraisal of the first DPF
in the series. The relevance of RI 4 is unsatisfactory.

      RI 5. MW of new NCRE installed.

RI 5 measured progress toward achievement of the objective 2 as a result of the actions conducted under PAs
4, 5, and 7. The indicator did not measure the status or impact of the implementation of carbon pricing
instruments which PA 5 supported. The indicator could be measured, and the information could be obtained.
The relevance of RI 5 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 6. MW of new energy storage awarded.

RI 6 was not relevant towards measuring the achievement of the objective because: (i) PA 6, which supported
this indicator, referred to establishing rules for installing energy storage systems, not for awarding them; and (ii)
the result was already achieved before the Board approved the first operation. The relevance of RI 6 is highly
unsatisfactory.

      RI 7. Equipares certification obtained by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).

RI 7 measured whether the certification was obtained but does not inform if the requirements for getting the
certification were a valid policy foundation for recovery through sustainable and resilient infrastructure and for

closing the gender gaps identified in the program documents. PA 8 supported this indicator. The indicator could
be measured, and the information obtained. The relevance of RI 7 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 8. Increase in freight transported by fluvial modes.

RI 8, associated with PAs 9 and 11, adequately measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward
achievement of the objective. The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 8 is
satisfactory.

      RI 9. Decrease in logistics costs as percentage of sales.

RI 9, associated with PAs 9-11, partly measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward achievement of the
objective. Logistic costs also included costs that were not associated with the program’s actions; therefore,
reductions in them could result from other developments in the economy unrelated to transport costs or logistic
processes in foreign trade. The relevance of RI 9 is moderately unsatisfactory.

      RI 10. Increase in registrations of vehicles that are fully electric.

RI 10, associated with PA 12, adequately measured the impact of the PA on progress toward achievement of
the objective. The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 10 is satisfactory.

      RI 11. Number of new mass transit co-financing agreements signed under the new governance and co-
       financing scheme.

RI 11, associated with PAs 13 and 14, adequately measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward
achievement of the objective. The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 11 is
satisfactory.

      RI 12. Percentage of total locations with 4G coverage.

RI 12, associated with PAs 15-17, partially measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward achievement of
the objective. The indicator did not report on coverage of internet in rural and non-commercial viable areas (PAs
15-16). The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 12 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 13. Percentage of population over 5 years old using the internet.

RI 13, associated with PAs 15-17, partially measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward achievement of
the objective. The indicator did not report on coverage of internet in rural and non-commercial viable areas (PAs
15-16). The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 13 is moderately satisfactory.

      RI 14. Number of existing and new structured concessions and PPP projects under new Fiscal
       Commitment and Contingent Liability Framework (FCCL).

RI 14, associated with PAs 18-21, adequately measured the impact of the PAs on progress toward achievement
of the objective. The indicator was measurable and verifiable. The relevance of RI 14 is satisfactory.

      RI 15. Estimated Capital expenditure (CAPEX) value of new infrastructure projects tendered under the
       fifth-generation infrastructure investments (5G) Program.

RI 15 partially measured the impact of the PAs 18-21 on progress toward achievement of the objective. The
indicator did not report on disaggregate results by sources of financing to be able to better assess the increase
in private investments in the new infrastructure projects under the 5G program. The indicator was measurable
and verifiable. The relevance of RI 15 is moderately satisfactory.

Of the 15 indicators, 4 were rated satisfactory (score: 5), 8 were rated moderately satisfactory (score: 4), 1 was
rated moderately unsatisfactory (score: 3), 1 was rated unsatisfactory (score: 2), and 1 was rated highly
unsatisfactory (score: 1), leading to a total average rating of 3.86, and an overall relevance of indicators rating of

Outcomes (ICR, paras 24-28 and annex 1):

Energy

      RI 4. 1,374 MW of NCRE was awarded under the October 2019 long-term energy auction. The
       awarded NCRE did not increase from the baseline to the actual, as described in section 4.
      RI 5. 833 MW of new NCRE was installed, exceeding the target of 200 MW.
      RI 6. 45 MW of new energy storage was awarded. The awarded new energy storage did not increase
       from the baseline to the actual, as described in section 4.
      RI 7. Equipares did not get its certification from the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). Target was
       not met.

Transport and Logistics

      RI 8. The freight transported by fluvial modes decreased to 4,770,000 ton/year, falling short from its
       target of 6,500,000 ton/year.
      RI 9. The logistics costs as percentage of sales decreased to 12.6 percent, exceeding the target of
       12.9 percent. That result of the indicator was not accepted because the logistic costs also included
       costs that were not associated with the program’s actions, as described in section 4.
      RI 10. The registrations of fully electric vehicles reached 8,128, exceeding its target of 4,300.

                  Digital Development

                        RI 12. 15 percent of total locations were with 4G coverage, falling short of the 30 percent target.
                        RI13. 73 percent of population over 5 years old were using the internet, exceeding the target of 72
                          percent.

                  Fiscal Management

                        RI 14. 14 existing and new structured concessions and PPP projects were under the new fiscal
                          contingent liability framework, falling short of the target of 19.
                        RI 15. Estimated CAPEX value of US$ 5.66 billion of new infrastructure projects were tendered under
                          the 5G Program, exceeding the target of US$ 1 billion.

                  Of the total of 12 RIs, four RIs were highly achieved, two RIs were substantially achieved, and the remaining

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Macroeconomic risk. There was a potential risk that the full achievements of the development outcome (e.g.,
digital development and mass transit systems) could be delayed due to the uncertainties regarding the long-term
economic effects of the COVID-19 crisis and of the medium-term fiscal framework (ICR, para 46). To mitigate
the risk, the new government, which was established on August 7, 2023, approved the new tax reform, and
proposed reforms related to the health sector, pensions; only the tax reform has passed. The other proposed
reforms, if Congress approves them, are likelier to deteriorate the fiscal outlook rather than to improve it (ICR,
para 46).

Risks related to institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability. There were potential risks that
the change in government might affect the sustainability of the sector strategies and the regulatory and policy
agendas (ICR, paras 47-48), in particular the outcomes on green growth. To mitigate the risk, the new
administration would need to ensure (i) sustaining the sector strategies including the prioritization of low-carbon
resources and technologies over fossil fuels despite of the pressures due to political economy considerations,
and (ii) improving relationships with the indigenous communities in La Guajira to complete the transmission lines
for the new renewable projects awarded through the two-sided auction (ICR, para 47).




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

The program design was sound, coherent, and reasonable. The World Bank staff drew on lessons from the
COVID-19 Crisis Response DPF in designing the program. The DPF series was prepared as an emergency
response operation to support the recovery of infrastructure and public services during the COVID-19 crisis. The
analytical underpinnings of PAs and RIs were adequate; they were based on a series of analytical contributions
to the country’s poverty reduction strategy that the World Bank financed in the four years before the COVID-19
crisis. The Program Documents identified the main risks and constraints to achieving PDOs. The mitigating
measures were sound. To mitigate the risks related to institutional capacity to implement the reform programs,
the World Bank implemented a parallel program for policy advisory and technical assistance to support the key
agencies. The program drew on consultations with relevant major stakeholders and benefited from close
coordination with development partners, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Inter-American

Development Bank (IADB), and other bilateral agencies. Thus, overall, the Bank performance at the design
stage is rated satisfactory.



Rating

Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

The implementation was sound. There was a monitoring of progress toward achievement of targets using the
results framework. According to the ICR (para 43), the World Bank conducted one mission during the two years
of the program’s implementation, monitored closely the implementation progress, and addressed arising issues
through technical guidance and support including the Gantt charts for overall program management. The
triggers, targets, and RIs were adapted appropriately to changes in underlying conditions and operational
priorities in general. For instance, the World Bank flexibly accommodated the government’s urgent needs of
strengthening its Emergency Preparedness and Response capacity, which was aligned with the PDO (ICR, para
43). On the other hand, the revision of results indicators at appraisal of the second DPF resulted in decreasing
the relevance of RI 6. The planned mitigating measures were implemented to address risks to achievement of
PDOs identified in the Program Document. Thus, overall, the Bank performance at the implementation stage is
rated satisfactory.



Rating

Satisfactory

c. Overall Bank Performance

Rationale

The overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory, as the Bank performance at both the design and
implementation stages are rated satisfactory.

The ICR did not report impacts.



b. Environmental

The ICR did not report impacts but comments that, at program closing, the environmental analysis of the two
operations indicated that they were not likely to have significant negative effects on the environment, forests,
and other natural resources (ICR, para 34).

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR presents a coherent account of the program that flows logically. The quality of analysis is adequate.
The lessons in the ICR are supported by the evidence and findings presented. The lessons focus on what can
be derived from experience with the operation and clearly present what should be done differently in the future
to improve impact. The ICR presents a sufficient and credible evidence based on critical information to support
the achievements reported. The ICR does not specifically identify actual observed impacts on the
social, poverty, environmental, and gender aspects in comparison to the potential impacts identified in the
program documents. For RI 1, no explanation was provided in the ICR regarding the downward change from the
original target of COP 600 billion at appraisal of the first DPF (PD 2020, annex 1, page 67) to the revised target
of COP 200 billion (PD 2021, annex 1, page 56). For RI 6, no explanation was provided in the ICR regarding the
downward revision of the indicator from the original statement of “installed” at appraisal of the first DPF (PD
2020, annex 1, page 69) to the revised statement of “awarded” (PD 2021, annex 1, page 56). The ICR’s quality,
overall, is substantial.

12. Lessons

The ICR (paras 49-52) provided four lessons. Three lessons are presented below with rephrasing as these
lessons may inform other multi-sector recovery program.

In post-crisis or low implementation capacity contexts, it is important to have a simple design and
centralized implementation arrangements for managing a multi-sector recovery program. It is
recommended to keep the program design and the implementation arrangements simple and mobilize trust fund
resources to complement the client's capacity.

The high number of indicators made it challenging for the DNP to effectively monitor and coordinate
actions and measure results from sectoral ministries, as revealed by interviews with DNP and MHCP
executives. It is important to design a results framework that measures well the achievement of objectives, the
program and result can be monitored, and clearly defines the coordination and monitoring control of indicators.

To improve emergency recovery programs, it is recommended to include a capacity building component
that incorporates lessons from the crisis and promotes a proactive risk management approach. There is
a need to further elaborate and standardize the Bank-executed or project-financed risk assessments, particularly
in infrastructure development and climate change impacts.
