2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The program documents (PD) for the two development policy grants (DPGs) defined the program development
objective (PDO) as “to support the consolidation of basic fiscal management and social inclusion.” (Paras. 29, 35
of first and second operation).” The financing agreements did not state the PDOs.

For purposes of this review, IEG assesses two objectives;

      PDO 1: To support the consolidation of basic fiscal management; and

      PDO 2: To support social inclusion.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The PD structured the Development Policy Grants (DPGs) (the program) around two policy areas (pillars)as
follows:

      Pillar 1. Consolidating basic fiscal management;

      Pillar 2. Supporting an inclusive economic recovery.




                                                                                                   Page 2 of 21

c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The program was financed from International Development Association (IDA) grants. The first (DPG1) was an
IDA grant in the amount of SDR 71.6 million (US$100 million equivalent). An additional financing (AF) grant of
SDR 18.4 million (US$25.5 million equivalent) was approved in 2022 to cover the unexpected financing gap
resulting from the COVID-19 crisis and allow the continued implementation of the reforms.

The second (DPG2) was an IDA grant in the amount of SDR 36.4 million (US$50 million equivalent). The total
amount disbursed under DPG1 and DPG2 was US$175.7 million.

Dates: DPG1 was approved on May 6, 2019, became effective on May 30, 2019, and closed on May 31, 2021,
five months after its initial closing date of December 31, 2020. DPG2 was approved on September 1, 2020,
became effective on October 14, 2020, and closed on December 31, 2021, as planned.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Relevance to country and sector context

 Central African Republic (CAR) is one of the most politically fragile and poorest countries in the world (pg. 8,
 PD). The presence of armed groups and relations between communities was tense at the preparation of
 DpG1, despite the cessation of active conflict. This fragility stems partly from civil war and widespread
 sectarian violence which started in early 2013, followed by the fall of the Bozizé régime, and conflict which
 lasted until 2019 when the Khartoum Agreement (more popularly known as the peace agreement) was
 signed in February 2019. Despite the peace agreement the situation remains tense with the presence of
 armed groups posing a continued threat to governance of the state.

 CAR is a landlocked, scarcely populated country with a population of approximately 5.4 million. However, it is
 endowed with ample natural resources. The country has faced continued political instability and cycles of
 violence since independence in 1960. At the time of preparation of DPG1, the poverty rate in CAR was
 estimated to have increased from 62 percent in 2008 to 69.7 percent in 2018. The population is mostly rural,
 with almost two-thirds in rural areas where poverty is estimated to be highest. Conflict resulted in the internal
 displacement of approximately one-fourth of the population, and an increase in refugees fleeing to
 neighboring countries.

 Overtime, CAR has experienced long-term deterioration of the economic, social, governance, and security
 situation. The DPG series was part of a wider international community support for post-conflict economic
 recovery, and the disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, and repatriation (DDRR) initiative (2018) to
 rebuild the economy and consolidate peace. At the time of preparation of DPG1, it was estimated that central
 government controlled only about 40 percent of the country, with armed groups continuing to exploit natural
 resources. At design, it was anticipated that the series of DPGs would also contribute to sustaining the 2019
 peace agreement in one of the most fragile and poorest countries in the world.

Relevance to country development strategy, CPF and WBG priorities

The program was closely aligned with the National Recovery and Peace Building Plan (Plan National
de Relèvement et de Consolidation de la Paix- RCPCA), CAR’s development strategy for the period
2017-2021. The RCPCA was extended by an additional two years, to 2023 after the February 2019
Khartoum peace agreement was signed. The program was aligned with the three pillars of the RCPCA: (I):
supporting peace, reconciliation, and security; (II) renewing the social contract between the state and the
population; and (III) ensuring economic recovery and boosting productive sectors. The program also
supported with the cross-cutting themes of the RCPCA around promoting transparency and accountability,
building the capacity of public institutions and civil society organizations, and promoting gender equity.

The program was also aligned with key strategic documents which supported development of critical areas in
CAR. These include the Government’s three-year PFM reform plan and the National Strategy for the
Restoration of State Authority 2017-2020 (RESA). On social interventions, the program built on the
Government’s national intersectoral plan to accelerate the development of human capital in the health sector
as well as the planned Government’s National Social Protection Strategy.

The program was also consistent with the three overarching objectives of the Country Engaging Note (CEN)
FY16-17: (a) restoration of core public sector institutions; (b) basic support to livelihoods; and (iii) support to
basic social service delivery. Pillar 1 of the program, consolidating basic fiscal management supported the
CEN objective related to restoration of core public sector institutions and consolidating public financial
management. Pillar 2, supporting an inclusive recovery, underscored the importance of supporting
livelihoods, basic social service delivery and fostering social inclusion. At the time of the design of PDG1, the
Country Partnership Framework (CPF) (FY21-25) was still under preparation. However, the first operation
benefitted from extensive work and the reforms grounded on the initial findings of the Systematic Country
Diagnosis (SCD) and other analytical support and were fully complementary to the World Bank’s investment
project finance. The SCD which was under preparation at the time of DPG1 had identified the three core
binding constraints in CAR as: (i) low level of security; (ii) grievances and inadequate services; (iii)
inadequate growth and job creation. The program sought to build on the achievements of the previous State
Policy Development Grant (SPDG) series.

DPG2 built on the first operation and was more closely aligned with the pillars of the Country Partnership
Framework that was under preparation at that time. It was closely aligned with the with the two focus areas
of the CPF (FY21-FY25), namely: (i) human capital and connectivity to boost stabilization, inclusion, and
resilience, and (ii) economic management and improved governance to build state legitimacy and foster
growth. DPG2 was also consistent with the Africa Region Framework for Operational Response to the
COVID-19 Pandemic and Global Crisis.

The program, through DPG2 was consistent with the third pillar of the WBG Strategy for Fragile Conflict and
Violent (FCV) 2020-2025 which focuses on supporting countries’ initiatives in renewing the social contract
between citizens and the state and strengthen the legitimacy and capacity of core institutions.

The two operations comprised of 19 prior actions (PAs), nine in DPG1 and ten in DPG2.

The PD for DPG2 presented an explicit theory of change. PAs 1-7 were in line with Objective 1 (to support
the consolidation of basic fiscal management), PAs 8-10 supported Objective 2 (to support social
inclusion). Some of the indicative triggers and prior actions were strengthened in DPG2, but there was no
material change to the PAs. Under PDO1, an additional activity was included as part of the budget
management reform, to increase transparency and accountability in the management of Covid-19 funds.

Two PAs formed the basis for the FY21 Performance and Policy Actions (PPAs) under the Sustainable
Development Finance Policy (SDFP) (pg. 6, ICR).

reforms, weaknesses in internal resource mobilization, budget credibility, inefficient procedures
and weaknesses in treasury management continued to undermine debt sustainability. The Code of
Transparency and Good Governance in PFM and the Organic Law on Public Finances supported under
DPG1 sought to further clarify the roles and responsibilities of parties responsible for implementing
government financial policy. PA1 is strongly linked with the PDO of strengthening public financial
management and will lay the foundation for a sound PFM system in line with the recommendations from the
Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC PFM directives. The relevance of PA#1 is
Satisfactory.

PA#2. Built on PA#1, by supporting the implementation of the new framework through decrees which would
establish the adoption of regulations and governing rules, in line with CEMAC’s standards directives on PMF
and international best practice for: (a) public accounting; (b) the preparation of statistics on the state’s
financial operations; (c) the state's chart of accounts and procedures; and (d) the budget nomenclature and
table of financial procedures. The rules sought to improve transparency, a necessary and important step
towards achieving better PFM. Adopting CEMAC’s standards constituted a significant improvement over the
existing standards. The relevance of PA#2 is Satisfactory.

PA#3. The Ministry of Finance and Budget and its Directorate General of Budget were solely responsible for
managing the budget and its expenditure chain, from commitments to authorization. As a result, budget
execution slowed down, and sectoral ministries lacked incentives to manage the budget properly, giving rise
to little control, little accountability and transparency, and disinterest in developing the capacity to manage
their finances. Budgetary discipline was undermined, and more than 10 percent of government spending was
authorized using exceptional spending procedures. PA#3 supported the government’s decision to delegate
the power of chief authorizing officer to officers to nine pilot ministries the authority (via the appointment of
financial controllers) to commit and validate expenditures for the 2019 financial year. This effort was to
reduce the use of exceptional spending procedures and supported PDO#1 to consolidate basic fiscal
management despite the short-term nature and appoint a financial controller in each of them. The relevance
of PA#3 is Satisfactory.

PA#4. PA#3 was further strengthened with the addition of a further 5 ministries for which financial controllers
and validation of expenditures would be required. IN addition to the ministries added, a specific COVID-19
expenditure monitoring committee was formed to monitor the execution of resources allocated to the
pandemic response. This PA supported the PDO in enhancing public financial management with the efforts
geared towards transparency and accountability in the use of COVID-19 resources, the establishment of an
audit mechanism and compliance with the already established budget management procedures for discipline
and control, The relevance of PA#4 is Satisfactory.

PA#5. This PA addressed the availability and quality of debt information through the publication of public debt
reports, as well as enhancing the quality of debt statistics. The lack of reliable and quality debt information
hindered the ability of officials to manage new borrowing in a prudent manner, contributing to high risk of debt
distress (pg. 16, ICR). The PA was in line with the objective of better PFM practices and contributed to
improved transparency on public debt. The relevance of PA#5 is Moderately Satisfactory.

PA#6. Wage bill management of the Agents and Civil Servants of the State (ACS) and the provision of
adequate public service across the largely rural population has been a perennial challenge for CAR. At the
time of the preparation of DPG1, it was estimated that the state presence outside of the capital of Bangui was
limited, with approximately 65 percent of civil servants based in Bangui. The limited presence of the state
outside of the Bangui was related in part to an unwillingness to accept ACS posts outside of Bangui as


                                                                                                     Page 8 of 21

access to and cost of receiving salary payments experienced by ACS served as a deterrent. ACSs would
have to travel long and dangerous journeys to urban centers to withdraw salaries or rely on informal
and costly mechanisms to receive their salaries through intermediaries (as high as 15 percent of their
income) (pg. 27, PD DPG1). These factors contributed in part to high levels of absenteeism which reduced
the effectiveness of the public service, and low levels of deployment of ACS across the country. A formal
mechanism for controlling and reporting of actual presence of ACSs was considered an important reform
towards the objective of better service delivery. The decree supported by PA#6 was the first step towards
implementing the changes necessary for better public service management and overtime, PFM. The
relevance of PA#6 is Satisfactory.

PA#7. This PA complemented PA#6 by supporting the framework to monitor the presence of ACS across
departments, agencies, and ministries. The publication of a cartography, a list of allocated and actual
presence by function, department, and allocation for ACS on the webpage of the Ministry of Finance and
Budget (MFB) was an important step in strengthening HR planning, management, and transparency. This
information would improve planning for the provision of service delivery in rural areas, especially in relation to
the presence of defense forces and police. The real-time and accurate information had an additional benefit
in effectively removing ghost workers from the payroll and improving efficiency in payroll management
through a reduction in wages and salaries. The PA sought to support additional reforms that would
effectively consolidate the prior gains made in human resource and wage bill management but also to expand
the services outside of Bangui and contribute to the objective of better PFM.

PA#7 also supported the adoption of the legal framework necessary to enable government digital and mobile
payments. This reform would enable the mobile payment of salaries of ACS, as part of the efforts for
restoration of state authority throughout the country. The reforms would also enable electronic declaration
and payment of taxes whereby citizens and firms would be able to access the services of the revenue
collection agencies and to declare and pay their taxes, duties, fees, and fines remotely thereby increasing the
mobilization of domestic resources. While presence of staff does not immediately result in better service
delivery, and the regulatory changes do not immediately result in an increase in revenue collection, the
reforms under this PA was an important step to improving public service delivery and efficiency. The
relevance of PA#7 is Satisfactory.

PA#8. Tax revenues had been low in CAR. In 2018 the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio was estimated at 8.9%
(about 2 percentage points below the average level in comparable countries). Despite continued efforts at
increasing revenue mobilization through tax system automation and tax modernization reforms, critical gaps
still existed in customs administration. PA#8 continued to build on these prior reforms with support to the
broader implementation of ASYCUDA++ to enhance trade facilitation and improve revenue collection. The
prior action supported the legal framework through a decree to transform one post, the post of Mongouba,
into a full boarder post for the purposes of collecting all taxes, particularly trade taxes. The PA also supported
administrative changes via a decree to give effect to the rotation of customs agents and border agents as a
means of dis-incentivizing fraud and corruption at the borders of entry. While the PA was an initial step
towards improving revenue management and transparency, it supported the program objective. The
relevance of PA#8 is Satisfactory.

PA#9. This PA built on PA#8, with a broader roll-out of the usage of ASYCUDA, or SYDONIA across
customs revenue collection agencies in other posts including Berberati, Gamboula, and Mongoumba. This
reform would contribute to improved customs procedures, more efficient declaration and payment of customs
duties and taxes and the automated clearance of petroleum products. The application of ASYCUDA for the
facilitation of petroleum products clearance was an important reform towards improved revenue and

                                                                                                      Page 9 of 21

PFM reform as petroleum products accounted for approximately 18 percent of tax revenues (2018). The
relevance of PA#9 is Satisfactory.

PA#10. The road network of CAR is the backbone of the transport system, but at the time of preparation of
DPG1, the network was widely underdeveloped and was in poor condition, with a road network density of
only 1.5 km per 100 km2 (compared to an average for Sub-Saharan Africa of 15 km per 100 km2) (pg. 17,
ICR). Despite the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) in 1981 to ensure the maintenance and
operations of the road sector, the fund had traditionally suffered from poor management and remained widely
inadequate to finance the maintenance and operations of the road sector. The reform under this PA
supported strengthening the governance and functioning of the RMF through the generation of financial
statements for the first and second quarters of 2018 and submission to the Central Accounting Agent or the
Directorate General of the Treasury and Public Accounting for analysis and recommendations on fiduciary
management. This was a first step to improving PFM through improved financial management and
oversight. The relevance of PA#10 is Satisfactory.

PA#11. Building on PA#10, the Central Accounting Agency of the Treasury recommended the use of an
internal control manual, by decree, to guide the operations of the RMF. The internal control manual was
expected to improve the quality of fiduciary management in the Fund, reducing the fiscal burden on the state,
and with additional knock-on effects on road maintenance. The relevance of PA#11 is Satisfactory.

PA#12. Weak governance permeated State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) which operated majority of the critical
sectors in CAR such as transportation (PAs#10 and 11), telecommunications, agriculture, environment, and
forestry. Financial oversight was traditionally weak, and the mechanisms for reporting were inadequate,
leading to incomplete reporting of the financial positions and debt obligations of SOEs. This PA sought to
address the financial weaknesses through PFM reforms and enhanced transparency with the publication of
audits for two entities, and the recruitment of audit firms to carry out audits for the five entities where audits
were not available. PA#12 supported MFB in publishing on its website the audit of two SOEs (the Forest
Development Fund and the Electronic Communications and Postal Regulatory Authority) and initiation of
audits for the other five SOEs (the National Civil Aviation Agency, the National Environment Fund, the Airport
Infrastructure Development Corporation, the Tourist Development Special Fund, and the National
Radioprotection Agency), a first step to enhancing PFM and fiscal management. The relevance of PA#12 is
Satisfactory.

PA#13. Given the initial steps taken under PA#12, this PA sought to strengthen the legal framework for SOE
oversight with the enactment of the SOE Law. The new SOE law sought to strengthen the governance,
oversight, and management of SOEs and parastatals in accordance with international best practice. The PA
was an important step towards enhancing fiscal management. The relevance of PA#13 is Satisfactory.

Objective 2: To support social inclusion

Instability and violence in CAR had resulted in substantial deterioration of human capital (pg. 33, PD
PDG2). CAR ranked 188 out of 189 on the 2019 United Nations Human Development Index, with life
expectancy at 53 years in 2019. The program sought to support a post-transition reform agenda to foster
human capital development and social inclusion by improving access to social protection, health, and
education services (pg. 33, PD PDG2).

PA#14. A long history of fragility and conflict and systemic weaknesses of the State have contributed to a
large vulnerable and poor population, with a significant number in need of social assistance (pg. 34,


                                                                                                    Page 10 of 21

PD PDG2). The conditions in CAR had contributed to a largely short-term humanitarian type of social
assistance which emerged primarily during times of crisis and focused largely on short-term help for
survival. The absence of a consolidated, comprehensive, and up-to-date information on social assistance
programs hindered the ability of the State to respond to the needs of the nearly 3.4 million people living in
extreme poverty, and the displaced population (25 percent). With an estimated 157 programs with social
protection components having been implemented between 2009 and 2015, this PA reform was an important
step towards coordination with the establishment of a Social Safety net unit by decree, and the establishment
of a Social Registry. Data on beneficiaries and programs was in important first step in mapping coverage,
identification of weaknesses related to duplication and gaps in programming. Overtime, better information,
and monitoring was expected to improve the quality and effectiveness of programs, an important first step in
strengthening social protection and building human capital. The relevance of PA#14 is Satisfactory.

PA#15. Building on PA#14, PA#15 had two parts. The first reform action was the roll-out of the government’s
first cash transfer program targeted 3,200 poor and vulnerable households (26,992 beneficiaries) in the city of
Berberati, all of whom were either displaced, returning refuges or host families. This program was
implemented by the Social Safety Net Unit which was supported under PA#14. The section part of this PA
sought to further strengthen the database on social assistance programs with a more formalized
approach. This reform supported the administration of a harmonized questionnaire to collect data from all
actors involved in the delivery of social assistance and humanitarian programs. The data collection from this
process was expected to be used for policy making and monitoring. The reforms under this PA were
additional steps along a gradual process of strengthening the social protection framework in terms of
coordination, targeting, coverage, and delivery, which would enhance effectiveness and efficiency in the long
run in CAR. The relevance of PA#15 is Satisfactory.

PA#16. Fragility and conflict had contributed to fundamental deficits in the health system in CAR, ranging
from a lack of access to essential medicines to shortages of skilled health workers, poor service delivery and
weak sector governance (pg. 37, PD PDG2). Amongst the main challenges, attention to maternal, child and
reproductive health and support to survivors of GBV were urgent at the time of preparation of
DPG1. Indicators for these specific areas were among the worst in the world with infant mortality for
example, estimated at 84.5 deaths per 1000 live births in 2018. The health system suffered from a lack of
coordination and fragmentation among the numerous actors including multilateral organizations and donor-
funded NGOs whose operation modality, like that of social protection focused on short-term health and
nutrition initiatives with little or no coordination by the Government. The reform supported under PA#16 was
two-fold. The first action, via the adoption of a Presidential Decree established targeted free healthcare for
children under-five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and victims of GBV. The second part of the reform
adoption of supported the scaling up of performance-based financing (PBF) in the health sector. PBF was
already in place for approximately 40 percent of facilities as of 2018, thereby harmonizing the methodology
across the state to improve effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery. The reforms under this PA
important aspects in supporting social inclusion with access to health care being an important pillar of human
development. The relevance of PA16 is Satisfactory.

PA#17. PA#17 built on the foundation set out in PA#16. The reform under this PA was a policy change, via
decree, to allocate resources to fund the implementation of free health care in seven districts. The allocation
of a dedicated budget line in the 2020 budget of CFAF 1 billion (or 0.27 percent of the 2020 budget) for
targeted free healthcare for 177 health facilities in seven districts (around 960,000 people) was expected
to demonstrate a commitment to providing free, integrated services and healthcare for the most vulnerable
population of children under five, pregnant and post-partum women and victims of GBV. While the PA was

 for one-year, and there was no indication of sustainability over time, it was an important step in the direction
 of service delivery for improved social inclusion. The relevance of PA#17 is Satisfactory.

 PA#18. The impact of fragility and conflict on the education sector in CAR had been severe. The 2013
 conflict further depleted an already inadequate education system, with girls being the most severely
 impacted. In 2018-19, access to primary schools was low, with almost a third of children of primary school
 age (6-11 years) out of school and just under 8 girls for every 10 boys enrolled at the primary level. At the
 secondary school level, the number of girls dropped to 6 girls for 10 boys enrolled at the secondary level.
 Gross enrolment ratio stood at 32 percent at the secondary level and only 2.3 percent at the tertiary level.
 The situation was further compounded by an inability of the state to adequately provide teachers and learning
 resources. The student teacher ratio in CAR was 91/1 at the primary level, compared to the regional average
 of 38/1 for SSA. The acute shortage of teachers stemmed from an inability of the government to hire, train,
 and deploy teachers at the rate that was required. For teachers who were hired issues around access to
 salaries which was a problem in the wider civil service, impacted the willingness of teachers to work in certain
 districts (at the local level), and contributed to higher absenteeism. The reforms under this PA sought to
 address the issues in the education sector with the adoption of the recommendations of a sector wide
 study. The PA supports the objective of social inclusion given the widespread challenges across the
 education sector. While the adoption of a plan is but one step along the results chain, the relevance of
 PA#18 is Satisfactory.

 PA#19 complemented PA#18 with additional actions to support the recruitment and deployment of
 teachers. The reforms under this PA supported (a) decentralization of the recruitment and management of
 teachers at the local Academic Inspection Directorates level. With this change, it was expected that the test
 to enter the National School for Teachers would be organized at the Academic Directorate level, so that after
 the pre-service training teachers would be deployed at the schools belonging the respective Academic
 Inspection Directorates. This reform would contribute to more teachers at the local level, and outside of the
 central Bangui area. This reform was reinforced with a framework which required recruited teachers to
 commit to their local directorates for a period of 5-yearsThe reform was an important step in addressing the
 teacher shortages, but it did not address other areas related to student attendance, provision of materials and
 supplies and other factors which may have contributed to the poor education outcomes at the primary
 level. The relevance of PA#19 is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

        use of exceptional spending procedures in DPG1. In DPG2, this indicator was revised as “percentage of
        exceptional spending procedures” to simplify the indicator and to ensure consistency with the statistics
        that was already being monitored under the government’s IMF program. The indicator was measurable,
        and the information was available from credible government sources. The relevance of RI#1 is

        resulted in the publication of annual debt reports. This RI was modified in DPG2 with an increase in the
        target number of reports from 2 to 3and an extension of the target year from 2020 to 2021. This change
        in the target year sought to account for the delays in implementation due to the pandemic and the 2020
        political crisis. The RI was an appropriate measure and easily verifiable. However, it was an output
        indicator rather than outcome oriented. The relevance of RI#2 is Moderately Satisfactory.
       RI#3 associated with PA#6 and PA#7, measured the percentage increase in Civil Servants and Agents
        of the State in secured areas. The indicator was unchanged in DPG2, but the target was increased, and
        the target year extended from 2020 to 2021, to account for implementation delays related in part to the
        COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 political crisis. RI#3 was clearly defined and measurable. The
        relevance of RI#3 is Satisfactory.
       RI#4 (associated with PA#8 and PA#9) measured the increase in revenues from international trade as a
        percentage of GDP. The RI was adjusted from “revenue from international trade in percent of GDP” to
        “customs duties and taxes processed through ASYCUDA” in DPG2 to establish a closer link between the
        PAs and the indicator. The target year was also extended from 2018 to 2021 to account for delays
        related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the political crisis in 2020. The indicator was measurable and
        linked directly to the PA. The relevance of RI#4 is Satisfactory.
       RI#5 associated with PA#10 and PA#11 sought to measure transparency with regards to the number of
        internal audit reports for the RMF. The target year was extended in the second operation from 2020 to
        2021, as COVID-19 and the 2020 political crisis impacted the progress. The RI was measurable and the
        information verifiable. The relevance of RI#5 is Moderately Satisfactory.
       RI#6 associated with PA#12 and PA#13 measured the number of published financial audits of SOEs and
        Parastatals. The target year was changed from 2020 to 2021 to take into account COVID-19 impacts
        and the political crisis. The RI was measurable and the information verifiable on a government portal.
        The relevance of RI#6 is Moderately Satisfactory.

Objective 2: To support social inclusion

     RI#7 associated with PA#14 and PA#15 measured the number of social protection beneficiaries in the
      harmonized social protection database. The RI was amended in DPG2 to reflect the changes which
      were undertaken in the second reform program. The indicators were changed to “number of households
      who benefit from unconditional cash transfers funded by the Government”. The target and the target
      year were amended to reflect number of actual beneficiaries of the specific government program, and the
      target year extended from 2020 to 2021. The amended indicator was a better measure of the reforms
      under PAs 14 and 15. The RI was measurable, and the information was available from the Ministry of
      Humanitarian Acton. The relevance of RI#7 is Satisfactory.
     RI#8 associated with PA#16 andPA#17 measured the number of health facilities which catered
      specifically to the targeted group of pregnant women, children under five-years and gender-based
      violence victims. This RI was amended in DPG2 to reflect the reform more accurately, and measured the
      number of districts which were targeted for free health care, including provision of essential
      medicines. The target year was also extended from 2020 to 2021. The target was amended from 393

      health facilities in DPG1 to a target of 7 districts to reflect the conditions more accurately in CAR. The
      relevance of RI#8 is Moderately Satisfactory.
     RI#9 associated with PA#18 and PA#19 sought to measure the percentage of education inspectorates
      which were recruiting teachers for initial training. This RI was amended in DPG2 to more accurately
      reflect the actions related to the reform. The RI was changed to reflect the percentage of primary school
      teachers recruited in 2019 who became teachers in their localities. As such, the target and target year
      were also amended. The amendment to the target year was to more accurately reflect the challenges
      experienced during the program. The RI was measurable and well defined. The relevance of RI#9 is
      Satisfactory.

   CSIDP 1 (P168035)



To support the consolidation of basic fiscal management


Rationale
There were six RIs under this objective. Of the six results indicators [RI1-RI6], three exceeded their targets
[RI3, RI4, RI6], two achieved their targets substantially, and one achieved little [RI5]. Most RIs were amended
in the second operation, and the target year extended by one year in many cases to account for delays and
the evolving situation in country. RI#1 on the use of exceptional procedure did not reach the expected target,
but there was an improvement from 11 percent in 2018 to 6.63 in 2021. While this RI was an important
indicator of government spending, under difficult situations of fragility and conflict, sustaining the PA related to
this RI may prove challenging. On transparency, pertaining to RI#2 on the publication of debt reports did not
meet the target of 3, but progress was recorded with two publications in 2021 and 2022, contributing in part to
the objective, the intention is clear, but the sustainability is questionable under the economic, social, and
political conditions in CAR. Similarly, RIs #5 and 6 on the audit of an SOE (the RMF) and publication of
financial audits of SOEs helped to improve SOEs and parastatals oversight and financial management,
contributing to the objective. However, these gains could easily be undermined with impending conflict as
was experienced during the program, in 2020. R#4 on the payment customs duties and taxes through the
ASYCUDA system was achieved, contributing to improvements in PFM and increasing domestic revenues,
and closely aligned with the objective of consolidating fiscal management. An increase in the presence of civil
servants and agents of the state (RI#3) was achieved.



Rating
Moderately Satisfactory



OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To support social inclusion

Rationale
There were three RIs under this objective. Of the three results indicators [RI#7-RI#9], only RI#7 was
achieved, as 3,163 households received government-funded unconditional cash transfers. Free healthcare
programs [RI#8] was not achieved, reflecting the dynamic and evolving social and political context in the
country. The political crisis in 2020 deemed some parts of the territory inaccessible, which hindered the
ability of the ministry to access some health facilities and monitor progress on this reform. While the indicator
was appropriate, the design of the PA and subsequently the RI could have better integrated the local
context. RI#9, which sought to measure the number of trained teachers who had been placed in local
communities, the target was not achieved. Given prior information related to the challenges in recruiting
teachers, the design of the PA and the RI could have been better targeted. A target of 80 percent of trained
teachers in the localities in which they had been trained was an ambitious target given the Ministry had not
been able to recruit and integrate teachers in their communities since 2014.

Moderately Satisfactory

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The reforms under the program are at a high risk of reversal given the fragile situation in CAR. Political unrest in
2020 had already undermined some of the ongoing reforms and the ability to meet the targets set. The risk to
project development outcomes is significant and spans most risk categories due in part to CAR’s status as a
conflict and fragile state with weak institutions, limited state capacity and ongoing conflict. Both program
objectives related to consolidating fiscal reforms and supporting social inclusion remain priorities in CAR.
Sustainability of the gains achieved during the operation remain at risk.

High risks of conflict can affect the ability of state enterprises to function, providing critical services to the
population and collecting taxes for the provision of these services and the operations of government. In
particular, the reforms related to ports and the use of ASYCUDA to process trade imports and exports, including

petroleum revenue could be undermined by security breaches at the ports. Political and governance risk was
rated high at design, due to the permanent political tensions in the country that can lead to violence and delays
in reform implementation and achievement of the objectives. This risk materialized over the course of the
operation with the violence that erupted following the December 27, 2020, presidential election, and remains a
risk to development gains.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

The Bank used existing evidence to inform program design and to assess and improve impact, drawing from
analytical work by the Bank, the IMF and government reports on health and education. Among the lessons used,
one was identifying priorities that could impact people’s living conditions immediately. Another was to target
reforms (e.g., customs, transparency, and accountability of SOEs and parastatals) that could impact critical
sectors of the economy. A third was to coordinate closely with other donors. In addition, DPG2 addressed issues
raised in the Bank's 2016 CAR Fragility Assessment, such as the lack of social cohesion and weak public
services. DPG2 also addressed the need to strengthen government capacity outside the capital region, as the
Bank's 2019 Systematic Country Diagnostic for CAR emphasized. DPG2 was also consistent with the Bank's
COVID Response Approach paper, with an additional activity to increase transparency and accountability in
managing Covid 19 funds. The analytical support underpinned the program, its theory of change, and its prior
actions, but it had less impact on the quality of the results indicators. The program identified the risks correctly
and adopted sound mitigating measures. One risk, capacity constraint, was addressed through technical
assistance and investment projects financed by the Bank and other development partners. The Bank cooperated
with development partners in developing the policy matrix and aligning the program with the budget support of
the European Union and the African Development Bank. The cooperation prevented duplicating other partners’
work.

Despite these positive points, the program’s support of objective 2 was more aspirational than realistic, as the
ICR notes (par. 58), pulling down the quality of the design. The country’s capacity constraints and political
instability were well-known; therefore, the program demanded a more realistic design, focusing on what was
implementable and monitorable and choosing indicators that took these conditions into account. In hindsight, the
indicators were less simple than what the DPG2 program document said (par. 34). The complex program design
comprising five-line ministries made appropriate monitoring difficult.

The Bank adjusted some prior actions and indicators in DPG, in response to the changing environment and
context. Target dates were extended due to the delays caused by COVID-19, and an evolving political crisis in
2020. The Bank also added a provision under PA2 to ensure transparency and accountability in the execution
of COVID-19 funds, in line with the Bank's COVID Response Approach paper, and closely coordinated with the
IMF. The program could have benefited from having at least one implementation status report (ISR), even if that
type of report is not mandatory for budget support operations.

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR presents the program’s performance and the evidence of achievements. Its analysis is of good quality,
forthright, credible, and supported by adequate information. The report explains how activities inform outcomes
and links the results to the program’s interventions. The report is internally consistent, and its parts are well-
integrated. Its lessons derive from the evidence presented and from the analysis of specific experiences of the
program.

12. Lessons

The most pertinent lessons from the ICR Review are:

      It is important to scrutinize the number and depth of reforms as well as the number and
       measurability of indicators to a country’s fragility and conflict context. Program design must probe
       if actions and indicators are aspirational, realistic, achievable, and monitorable. In this case, an added
       challenge was that the EU and AFD were providing budget support in the same sectors simultaneously,
       straining government capacity while risking duplication.
      Countries with persistent political instability are unlikely to execute an ambitious program of
       reforms over a short period. Therefore, program design needs to be tailored and aligned with the
       limitations of public sector capacity and must be complemented with a well-structured technical
       assistance program to help deliver the results the program seeks.
      Robust monitoring and evaluation systems are essential, especially if institutional capacity is
       weak, many actors implement the program, and coordinating them is difficult. Under these

                                                                                                    Page 20 of 21

      CSIDP 1 (P168035)



        conditions, the program design must develop a robust monitoring and evaluation system that includes
        the parties involved in the program and ensures that it starts operating when the loans or grants become
        effective.
       Programs face high implementation risks in countries with tight fiscal constraints and whose
        budget financing depends significantly on external sources. The free health care services and
        unconditional cash transfer programs exemplify these risks; the government could not execute the first
        for lack of funds. The second, a pilot, barely reached its goals, and its sustainability is unclear.


13. Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) Recommended?

Yes
ASSESSMENT_TABLE
Please explain
The operations sought to improve basic fiscal management and social inclusion with the support of some
actions that at first reading might seem too weak for a country affected by fragility, conflict and violence. The
PPAR would help to answer the following questions:

       Were the actions appropriate to achieve the goals set?
       Would a more demanding set of actions have produced better results?
       Did the country have the institutional conditions to implement more demanding actions and where and
         why did the WBG fail to identify those conditions?
