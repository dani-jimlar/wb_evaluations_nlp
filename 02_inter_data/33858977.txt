  US$35.92 million (government)] supported: (a) the provision by the Long-Term Financing Facility (LTFF) of
  sub-loans to participating financial institutions for on-lending to eligible sub-borrower private
  enterprises; and (b) the provision of technical assistance to the participating financial institutions and related
  stakeholders on selected aspects of the financial sector, including on developing long-term finance markets
  and products and on managing safeguards.

  Project Implementation and Monitoring (US$2.5 million estimated at appraisal – US$2 million (IDA) and
  US$0.5 million (government), US$0.25 million disbursed by closing – US$0.2 million (IDA) and US$0.05
  million (government)] supported: (a) the project management activities, including strengthening the fiduciary
  and safeguards management capacity of the Bangladesh Bank; (b) the project monitoring and evaluation
  activities; and (c) the implementation of the Governance and Accountability Action Plan, designed to
  strengthen management control over the project, reduce potential risks, and ensure the realization of the
  project objectives.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  Project Cost. The project was estimated to cost US$350 million at appraisal.

  Project Financing. The project was financed by an SDR 213.4 million (US$300 million equivalent) credit
  from the International Development Association to the Republic of Bangladesh. The amount of US$262.2
  million of the IDA credit was disbursed by closing (87.4 percent of the original credit).

  Borrower Contribution. A financial contribution from the Republic of Bangladesh of US$50 million was set
  at appraisal. The amount of US$41.92 million of the government's contribution was disbursed by closing
  (84 percent of the planned contribution).

  Dates. The project was approved on June 5, 2015, became effective on September 20, 2015, and closed
  on March 31, 2021, six months later than the original closing date of September 30, 2020.

  Restructuring. The project was restructured twice. The project development objective was not changed at
  restructuring. The first restructuring on October 23, 2019, with US$263.27 million disbursed (88 percent of
  the US$300 million of the IDA project funds), revised some of the project outcome and output indicators,
  changed some of the project cost items (see Section 3.D), and, as a result, reallocated the IDA project
  funds between disbursement categories (SDR 8.4 million, or US$11.5 million equivalent, reallocated from
  the first to the third component of the project). The second restructuring on February 27, 2020, with
  US$273.27 million disbursed (91 percent of the IDA project funds) extended the closing date by six months
  - to allow more time for sub-loans to be disbursed and IT packages to be installed.

  Revised Results Indicators and Targets. Changes in some of the project results indicators at the first
  restructuring, including in the associated results targets, require a split rating of the outcome of this project
  (see Section 4 and Section 6).

        One outcome indicator and one output indicator were restated for clarity: (a) the outcome indicator
         "Certification of the Bangladesh Bank Against ISO270001 and the Control Objectives for Information
         and Related Technology (COBIT)" was restated as “Uptime of the Core Systems of the Bangladesh
         Bank - Core Banking System, Payment Systems, Credit Reporting System, and Marketing
         Infrastructure Module” as the former was difficult to interpret; and (b) the output

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 27

          indicator, "Cumulative Number of Training Of Trainers, Awareness Campaigns and Workshops
          Delivered to Industry Associations on Safeguards and Health and Safety" was restated to become
          “Cumulative Number of Participants and Trainees at Training of Trainers and Other
          Workshops Delivered to Industry on Safeguards and Health and Safety”, with a target of 50, as
          "awareness campaigns" was difficult to quantify.
         One outcome indicator and one output indicator were reclassified: (a) “High Level of Operational
          Reliability as Measured by the Improved Compliance of Bangladesh Bank with the Principle 17 of
          the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructures” was reclassified as an output
          (intermediate result) rather than outcome (PDO-level) indicator; and (b) "Uptime of the Core
          Systems of the Bangladesh Bank - The Core Banking System, Payment Systems, Credit Reporting
          System, and Marketing Infrastructure Module" was reclassified as an outcome rather than output
          indicator.
         The target for one outcome indicator, “Performance on the BCP Assessment - Number of Principles
          on which Bangladesh Bank is Judged as Largely Compliant and Compliant,” was revised downward
          from 12 BCP principles to eight to reflect a more realistic goal (see Section 4 - Objective 2). The
          targets for two output indicators were revised downward: (a) the target for "Cumulative Number of
          BB Banking Supervision Officers Trained on Risk-Based Supervision" was revised downward from
          500 to 300 to reflect the smaller number of actual supervision officers who would benefit from
          the training; and (b) the target for "Direct Project Beneficiaries (Firms)" was revised downward from
          250 to 55 to reflect the new projections for a significantly higher average sub-loan size (see Section
          4 - Objective 3).
         Four output indicators were dropped as they were no longer considered relevant to the project or
          had been achieved outside the remit of project: (a) "Observance the General Principles of Credit
          Reporting" – observance of the credit reporting principles was not part of the project design; (b)
          "Publication and Dissemination of Study on Warehouse Receipt Financing in Bangladesh" – the
          activity was to delivered by the Bank of Bangladesh on its own budget and not financed by the
          project; (c) "Financial Inclusion Strategy Drafted and Approved" – the activity was to be delivered
          with support from the U.K. Department for International Development and not financed by the
          project; and (d) "Publication and Dissemination of Two Analytical and Policy Research Papers on
          the Development of Long-Term Capital Markets and on the Pensions Market" – the activity was to
          be delivered by the Joint Capital Markets Assessment Program (JCAP) of the Bank and not financed
          by this project.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Binding Constraints. The World Bank's Bangladesh Systematic Country Diagnostic - More and Better
Jobs to Accelerate Shared Growth and Extreme Poverty identified "strengthening financial stability" and
"improving financial intermediation" as "key challenges" to sustaining economic growth in
Bangladesh. According to the Project Appraisal Document (pages 18-19) and the ICR (pages 1-2):

      The financial market infrastructure – the system among participating institutions, including the
       operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, and recording payments,
       securities, derivatives, and other financial transactions – remained a rudimentary system in

                                                                                                    Page 4 of 27

       Bangladesh that needed technological and operational upgrading. The "basic platform" – the
       payments and remittance systems, centralized credit system, securities settlement system, and
       the compliant and integrated financial intelligence system, all managed by the Bangladesh Bank as
       the sole facility provider and constructed earlier with the assistance of the Bank and other donors –
       needed modernization and integration of its constituent parts and with external systems to help
       improve financial market efficiency, promote financial system stability, and enhance the
       effectiveness of monetary policy transmission.
      The Bangladesh Bank, the banking regulator and supervisor, lacked the institutional independence,
       the enforcement powers, and the technical capacity to effectively regulate the banking market,
       intervene in problem banks, and address financial sector vulnerabilities even as financial markets
       had rapid evolved and grew in complexity. Weaknesses in regulation and supervision were partly
       reflected in capital shortages at banks, rising non-performing loans in bank portfolios, and cases of
       financial scams and irregularities. The Bangladesh Bank needed to increasingly improve its
       regulatory and supervisory framework and practices to the level of international norms and
       standards set by the Basel Accords – the series of three sequential banking regulation
       agreements (Basel I, II, and III) set by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision.
      Banks were unable to meet the demand from manufacturers and exporters for long term
       finance. Long term finance constituted only 19 percent of total bank lending in 2013. Less than 3
       percent of foreign currency-denominated loans to exporters were more than three years in tenor,
       according to a Bank survey, and none of the respondent banks in the survey offered loans with a
       maturity of five years or more. The lack of long term finance for industry stemmed in part on the
       limited access by the banks to long term resources. Less than 20 percent of banks' liabilities were
       term deposits. The consequence of these was that long term investments were limited as
       well. Private capital investment reached only 19 percent of GDP, far under the target in the national
       development plan of 32 percent of GDP, constraining private competitiveness, export diversification,
       and economic modernization.

Government Priorities. The project objectives were aligned with the government's medium-term
priorities. "Improving the efficiency of the financial sector" would be one of the "key drivers for growth",
according to the 7th Five Year Development Plan FY2016-FY2020 - Accelerating Growth, Empowering
Citizens, which aimed to raise economic growth to an annual 7.4 percent over the period 2016-20. The
efficiency and health of the financial sector would be strengthened by easing controls over the interest rate,
instilling better banking supervision and oversight by the Bangladesh Bank, and promoting the
corporatization of the public banks. The plan document emphasized that the maturity of the financial sector
and long-term economic development were strongly correlated.

Bank Group Strategy. The project objectives were consistent with the Bank Group's strategy in
Bangladesh. The Country Partnership Framework for Bangladesh for the Period FY16-FY20 (CPF)
supported the country's development program organized around three "focus areas" – growth and
competitiveness, social inclusion, and climate and environment management. The project objectives
were consistent with the first CPF focus area, specifically with the objective "to increase financial
intermediation" by "strengthening the foundations of the financial system and markets," improving "the
ability of financial institutions to deliver long-term financing," and "enhancing financial inclusion." Among
the key targets supported by the CPF for increasing financial intermediation were: (a) getting the
Bangladesh Bank to be judged as largely compliant on 12 (out of 29) of the Core Banking Principles for
Banking Supervision of the Basel Committee; (b) raising the volume of long-term finance from financial
institutions for manufacturing, services, and infrastructure investments to US$4.5 billion; (c) reducing the
ratio of non-performing loans in the portfolio of financial institutions for foreign currency-denominated long-

EFFICACY_TBL




                             OBJECTIVE 1
                             Objective
                             To improve the financial market infrastructure.

                             Rationale
                             Theory of Change. The Bangladesh Bank managed a financial market infrastructure that needed technical
                             and operational upgrading. The procurement of IT and Management Information System (MIS) hardware and
                             software and the provision of technical assistance would improve the operational reliability of the
                             system consistent with the Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructures (2012) set by the Committee on
                             Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International
                             Organization of Securities Commission (CPSS-IOSCO). The other salient parts of the financial market
                             infrastructure upgrading – the enhancement of Bangladesh Bank's capacity to manage IT assets, the
                             modernization of the Credit Information Bureau, and the development of the systems of the Bangladesh
                             Financial Intelligence Unit – would increase the uptime of the core banking system, reduce operational
                             disruptions, spur the growth of e-payments and e-transfers by the government, enhance credit risk
                             management by financial institutions, and boost the ability of the authorities to address AML/CFT
                             risks. Overall, these measures would lead to a more efficiently functioning financial market infrastructure.

                             Outputs. The project did not achieve the original output target set for the objective to improve the financial
                             market infrastructure.

                                        The output that compliance with the General Principles of Credit Reporting (World Bank, 2011)
                                          be “broadly observed” was not achieved as originally targeted. The declaration would have been
                                          made by the Bangladesh Bank using a self-assessment methodology that would be subsequently
                                          “peer-reviewed” by the International Committee on Credit Reporting, the international standard setter
                                          on credit reporting. This output target would be dropped at restructuring because the observance of
                                          the General Principles of Credit Reporting was not part of the project implementation plan (ICR, page
                                          56).

                             Outcomes. The project exceeded one, partially achieved another, but failed to achieve a third of the three
                             original outcome targets set for the objective to improve the financial market infrastructure.

                                        The outcome that Bangladesh Bank be certified against ISO 270001 and COBIT was not achieved as
                                          originally targeted. ISO 270001 is the international standard on how to manage information security

       International Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), the international professional
       association focused on international technology governance. The outcome target would be dropped
       at restructuring because it was “not reflective of the ultimate objective” (ICR, page 56).
      The percentage of government payments by value processed through electronic means (annually)
       rose from 10 percent in the baseline (September 2014) to 98.3 percent by closing (December 2020),
       exceeding the target of 40 percent. The result exceeded the target as early as the first year of project
       implementation when it reached 94.9 percent in 2016.
      A "high level of operational reliability", measured by the degree of compliance by Bangladesh
       Bank with the Principle 17 of the Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructures (2012) of the CPSS-
       IOSCO, which was "not observed" in the baseline, was only "partially observed" at closing, partially
       achieving the target that a "high level of operational reliability" be "broadly observed." Principle 17 -
       Operational Risk required that financial market institutions must identify operational risks, both
       internally and across the market and its participants, and where appropriate, should mitigate the risks
       through appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls.

Additional Information. In addition to the foregoing results, the following were achieved, according to the
ICR (page 39):

      There was a large-scale adoption and use of electronic payments by the government.
      The ability of Bangladesh Bank to manage its IT assets was strengthened. According to the World
       Bank staff, three activities helped enhance the ability of Bangladesh Bank to manage its IT assets: (a)
       the creation of data centers and recovery centers; (b) the establishment of internal processes and
       protocols for data management and cyber security; and (c) the training of IT staff. The World Bank
       judged the ability of Bangladesh Bank to manage its IT assets as stronger than before the operation
       because: (a) the Bangladesh Bank was finally able to prepare and submit a CPSS-IPSCO Principles
       Self-Assessment which was acceptable to the World Bank Payments System team, and (b) the
       Bangladesh Bank managed to introduce technology solutions for banking market development.

Based on this, the objective is rated Substantial with some shortcomings.

OBJECTIVE 1 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
To improve the financial market infrastructure.

Revised Rationale
Theory of Change. The Bangladesh Bank managed a financial market infrastructure that needed technical
and operational upgrading. The procurement of IT and Management Information System (MIS) hardware and
software and the provision of technical assistance would improve the operational reliability of the
system consistent with the Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructures (2012) set by the Committee on

                                                                                                   Page 7 of 27

Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the International
Organization of Securities Commission (CPSS-IOSCO). The other salient parts of the financial
market infrastructure upgrading – the enhancement of Bangladesh Bank's capacity to manage IT assets, the
modernization of the Credit Information Bureau, and the development of the systems of the Bangladesh
Financial Intelligence Unit – would increase the uptime of the core banking system, reduce operational
disruptions, spur the growth of e-payments and e-transfers by the government, enhance credit risk
management by financial institutions, and boost the ability of the authorities to address AML/CFT
risks. Overall, these measures would lead to a more efficiently functioning financial market infrastructure.

Outputs. The project partially achieved the sole output target set for the objective to improve the financial
market infrastructure.

      A "high level of operational reliability", measured by the degree of compliance by Bangladesh

      The uptime of the total core systems of the Bangladesh Bank – a measure of IT infrastructure capacity
       – rose from 95 percent in the baseline to 99 percent by closing, exceeding the target of 98
       percent. The data was obtained from the Information Systems Development and Support Department
       of Bangladesh Bank. The core systems of Bangladesh Bank consisted of the core banking system
       (the back-end system used for key banking activities including transactions processing and account
       onboarding), the payment systems, credit reporting system, and marketing infrastructure module.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To improve the regulatory and oversight capacity of the Bangladesh Bank.

Rationale
Theory of Change. Bangladesh had a financial sector that had become vulnerable in part because of weak
banking regulation and supervision. Technical assistance – including through staff training and expert
advisory services on risk-based supervision – to strengthen the legal framework and the institutional capacity
for regulation and supervision would enable the Bangladesh Bank as to increasingly comply with the Basel
Core Principles. A circular for prompt corrective action, following an amendment to the Banking Act, would
allow the banking regulator and supervisor to deal more effectively with under-capitalized banks and to
intervene with problem banks. The development of the policy framework governing AML/CFT and capacity
building at the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit would help the authorities to better manage AML/CFT
risks. Better regulation and supervision would enhance the soundness of the banking sector.

Outputs. The project exceeded two of three original output targets set for the objective to improve the
regulatory and oversight capacity of the Bangladesh Bank.

      The uptime of the total core systems of the Bangladesh Bank – a measure of IT infrastructure capacity
       – rose from 95 percent in the baseline to 99 percent by closing, exceeding the target of 98
       percent. The data was obtained from the Information Systems Development and Support Department
       of Bangladesh Bank. The core systems of Bangladesh Bank consisted of the core banking system
       (the back-end system used for key banking activities including transactions processing and account
       onboarding), the payment systems, credit reporting system, and marketing infrastructure module.
      The cumulative number of Bangladesh Bank banking supervision officers trained on risk-based
       supervision reached 521 at closing, exceeding the revised target of 300 (as well as the original target
       of 500).
      The Bangladesh Bank had only prepared the draft circular on prompt corrective action by the project
       closing date, failing to meet the target that the circular be issued by that date. According to the ICR
       (page 35), the provision on prompt corrective action was included in a new chapter, "Part 6A -
       Management of Weak Banks," in the proposed Bank Company Act (Amendment) of 2021, the draft of
       which had not been approved by the Cabinet in May 2021. The circular on prompt corrective
       action will be issued and published after the final Bank Company Act (Amendment) is
       enacted. Regulatory relief, associated with Bangladesh's policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
       delayed action on these measures.

Outcomes. The project did not achieve the sole outcome target set for the objective to improve the
regulatory and oversight capacity of the Bangladesh Bank.

      The number of principles of the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision of the Basel
       Committee (last updated 2012), also known as the Basel Core Principles (BCP) – the minimum global

       standards for the sound prudential regulation and supervision of banks – on which Bangladesh Bank
       is judged as "compliant" and "largely-compliant" increased from four in the baseline to seven by
       closing, failing to achieve the original target of 12 principles (58 percent achievement rate). A
       comprehensive assessment of the Bangladesh banking system against the BCP was conducted jointly
       by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank as part of the Financial Sector Assessment
       Program (FSAP) in March 2019. The seven BCP principles on which the FSAP found Bangladesh
       Bank to be largely-compliant were: BCP 3 - Cooperation and Collaboration; BCP 4 - Permissible
       Activities; BCP 7 - Major Acquisitions; BCP 10 - Supervisory Reporting; BCP 13 - Home-Host
       Relationships; BCP 22 - Market Risk; and BCP 24 - Liquidity Risk. According to the ICR (page 33),
       the Bank ICR mission for this project also found that Bangladesh Bank had made major progress
       toward compliance with more BCP principles. Under the Bangladesh Financial Sector Support
       Project (FSSP) approved in 2015, Bangladesh Bank had hired a bank supervision consultant, AFC
       Germany, which worked with the Banking Regulations and Policy Department, the Banking Inspection
       Departments, and the Department of Off-Site Supervision, and identified six additional BCP
       principles where significant progress was achieved and could be assessed next for compliance: BCP
       5 - Licensing Criteria; BCP 14 - Corporate Governance; BCP 21 -Country and Transfer Risks; BCP 23
       - Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book; BCP 26 - Internal Control and Audit; and BCP 28 -
        Disclosure and Transparency. However, there was not another FSAP before the project closing date
       of September 2020 – any assessment of compliance with the BCP principles could only be made
       under a formal FSAP process.

Additional Information. In addition to the foregoing results, the following were achieved, according to the
ICR (page 39):

      There was increased effectiveness at the Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit, the government
       agency responsible for investigating money laundering, suspicious transactions, and cash transaction
       reports. The World Bank determined that the effectiveness of Bangladesh Bank was stronger than
       before the operation: (a) the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental organization
       that helps states develop policies against money laundering and terrorism financing, reported in 2019
       that Bangladesh had achieved important progress on five recommendations advanced in 2016,
       namely, R9 - Financial institution secrecy laws, R16 - Wire transfers, R18 - Internal controls and
       foreign branches and subsidiaries, R26 - Regulation and supervision of financial institutions, and R34
       - Guidance and feedback, and that Bangladesh was nor rated “compliant” on these five
       recommendations, compared to being only “partially complaint in 2016; and (b) the Bangladesh
       Financial Intelligence Unit had upgraded it rules and regulations regarding AML/CFT.
      The detection of AML/CFT cases improved. In 2020-21: (a) banks submitted Cash Transactions
       Reports covering 20.6 million transactions, valued at Bangladesh taka (BDT) 14.4 trillion; (b) and non-
       bank financial institutions, 1,267 transactions, valued at BDT 2.1 billion; (c) the Bangladesh Financial
       Intelligence Unit received 1,414 information exchange requests from law enforcement agencies; (d)
       and 5,280 suspicious transaction activity reports compared to 3,675 such reports in 2019-20.

OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
To improve the access to long-term financing for private firms.

Rationale
Theory of Change. Manufacturers and exporters lacked access to long-term finance, the supply of which
was bound by the banks' own limited access to long-term resources. Providing long-term loan funds in
foreign currency to participating financial institutions for on-lending to manufacturers and exporters would
enable these borrowers to undertake capital projects, expand their operations, and thence compete, grow,
and create jobs. Additionally, providing technical assistance to the participating financial institutions and the
industry associations of manufacturers and exporters on project finance, credit management, and
environmental and social safeguards would, though demonstration effects and knowledge transfer, lead to
foreign currency to participating financial institutions for on-lending to manufacturers and exporters would
enable these borrowers to undertake capital projects, expand their operations, and thence compete, grow,

                                                                                                    Page 12 of 27

and create jobs. Additionally, providing technical assistance to the participating financial institutions and the
industry associations of manufacturers and exporters on project finance, credit management, and
environmental and social safeguards would, though demonstration effects and knowledge transfer, lead to
better credit and business practices by banks and borrowers. Finally, policy analytical support would aid in
the development of the market for long-term finance for private enterprise.

Outputs. The Government completed three original output targets that were, however, subsequently
dropped from the project because they were financed by resources other than the World Bank project
funds. Because they were not financed by the project funds, the achievement of these outputs cannot be
credited to this project. Meanwhile, the project exceeded the remaining six of the nine original output targets
set for the objective to improve the access to long-term financing for private firms.

      The Government completed, published, and disseminated the planned study on warehouse receipt
         financing, which would help set the enabling environment and regulatory framework for viable,
         scalable, and tradeable warehouse receipts and hence be useful for the development of the
         agriculture finance sector. This output target would be dropped at restructuring because the
         Government funded the study with its own budgetary resources, removing this activity from the
         coverage of the project.
        The Government completed the preparation and secured the approval of the National Financial
         Inclusion Strategy for Bangladesh, which would set the roadmap, implementation plan, and
         dissemination plan for a national strategy for financial inclusion informed by a comprehensive
         assessment of the current status of financial inclusion in the country. This output target would be
         dropped at restructuring because the government obtained funding for the preparation of the National
         Financial Inclusion Strategy from U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), removing
         this activity from the coverage of the project.
        The Government completed the publication and dissemination of two analytic and policy research
         papers on the development of long-term capital markets (particularly of the secondary bond market)
         and of the pension market in Bangladesh. This output target would be dropped at restructuring
         because the government obtained funding for the publication and dissemination of the two research
         papers from the Joint Capital Market Program (JCAP), the multi-donor trust fund administered by the
         World Bank and the International Finance Corporation to support the development of capital markets,
         removing this activity from the coverage of the project.
        The number of direct project beneficiaries reached 56 firms by closing, exceeding the revised target of
         55 (the original target was 250). In addition to the sub-loan disbursements for 56 firms, two more sub-
         loan applications were approved, and one was in the pipeline. The original target of 250 sub-
         borrowers was based on assumptions of an average sub-loan size of US$1.2 million per sub-
         borrower. The revised target of 55 sub-borrowers used projections of an average sub-loan size of
         US$3-5 million, which considered the sub-project proposals of exporters for large-scale capital
         investments in technology.
        The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in project's foreign currency-denominated long-term finance
         portfolio (the ratio of the amount of non-performing loans to the amount of outstanding loans held in
         the portfolio) was reduced to zero percent, meeting the target that NPL ratio not exceed 7
         percent. None of the 56 sub-projects financed had overdue payments; all were classified as standard
         and performing at closing.
        The number of participating financial institutions reached 21, exceeding the target of 10. The target
         was exceeded by the first year of project implementation.

       revised target of 50 (the original target was 60). The target was exceeded by the fourth year of project
       implementation.

Outcomes. The project exceeded the sole outcome target set for the objective to improve the access to
long-term financing for private firms.

      The outstanding foreign-currency long-term loans of participating financial institutions rose from
       US$300 million in the baseline to US$856 million at closing, exceeding the target of US$550
       million. The target was exceeded after the second year of project implementation, when the
       outstanding foreign-currency long-term loans of participating financial institutions reached US$627
       million in June 2017. Consistent with the practice, common in World Bank financial intermediary
       loans, that participating financial institutions partly finance sub-loans to borrowers, the incremental
       long-term foreign-currency loan portfolio of participating financial institutions (US$856 million at
       closing minus US$300 million in the baseline = US$556 million) can be attributed to the following
       funding sources: (a) drawdowns from this World Bank credit = US$237.9 million; (b) contributions by
       the Borrower = US$35.9 million; and (c) private funds mobilized by the participating financial
       institutions, including of reflows from the initial rounds of sub-lending = US$273.8 million.

Additional Information. In addition to the foregoing results, the following were achieved, according to the
ICR (page 39):

      Long-term lending was catalyzed through both the demonstration effect and the competition effect
       provided by this project. Financial institutions that were not participating in the project started offering
       foreign-currency long-term loans at terms comparable to that provided under this project.

OBJECTIVE 3 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
To improve the access to long-term financing for private firms.

Revised Rationale
Theory of Change. Manufacturers and exporters lacked access to long-term finance, the supply of which
was bound by the banks' own limited access to long-term resources. Providing long-term loan funds in
foreign currency to participating financial institutions for on-lending to manufacturers and exporters would
enable these borrowers to undertake capital projects, expand their operations, and thence compete, grow,
and create jobs. Additionally, providing technical assistance to the participating financial institutions and
the industry associations of manufacturers and exporters on project finance, credit management, and


                                                                                                    Page 14 of 27

environmental and social safeguards would, though demonstration effects and knowledge transfer, lead to
better credit and business practices by banks and borrowers. Finally, policy analytical support would aid in
the development of the market for long-term finance for private enterprise.

Outputs. The project exceeded all six output targets set for the objective to improve the access to long-term
financing for private firms.

      The number of direct project beneficiaries reached 56 firms by closing, exceeding the revised target of
         55 (the original target was 250). In addition to the sub-loan disbursements for 56 firms, two more sub-
         loan applications were approved, and one was in the pipeline. The original target of 250 sub-
         borrowers was based on assumptions of an average sub-loan size of US$1.2 million per sub-
         borrower. The revised target of 55 sub-borrowers used projections of an average sub-loan size of
         US$3-5 million, which considered the sub-project proposals of exporters for large-scale capital
         investments in technology.
        The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio in project's foreign currency-denominated long-term finance
         portfolio (the ratio of the amount of non-performing loans to the amount of outstanding loans held in
         the portfolio) was reduced to zero percent, meeting the target that NPL ratio not exceed 7
         percent. None of the 56 sub-projects financed had overdue payments; all were classified as standard
         and performing at closing.
        The number of participating financial institutions reached 21, exceeding the target of 10. The target
         was exceeded by the first year of project implementation.
        The cumulative number of financial institution officers receiving training or attending workshops on risk
         management, safeguards, and commercial practices in procurement reached 261, exceeding the
         target of 45. The target was exceeded by the first year of project implementation.
        The cumulative number of participants and trainees at Training of Trainers (TOT) and other
         workshops delivered to industry on safeguards and health and safety reached 55, exceeding the
         revised target of 50 (the original target was 60). The target was exceeded by the fourth year of project
         implementation.
        The percentage of direct project beneficiary firms and participating financial institutions that felt that
         the project financing reflected their needs was 95 percent by closing, exceeding the target of 70
         percent.

Outcomes. The project exceeded the sole outcome target set for the objective to improve the access to
long-term financing for private firms.

      The outstanding foreign-currency long-term loans of participating financial institutions rose from
         US$300 million in the baseline to US$856 million at closing, exceeding the target of US$550
         million. The target was exceeded after the second year of project implementation, when the
         outstanding foreign-currency long-term loans of participating financial institutions reached US$627
         million in June 2017. Consistent with the practice, common in World Bank financial intermediary
         loans, that participating financial institutions partly finance sub-loans to borrowers, the incremental
         long-term foreign-currency loan portfolio of participating financial institutions (US$856 million at
         closing minus US$300 million in the baseline = US$556 million) can be attributed to the following
         funding sources: (a) drawdowns from this World Bank credit = US$237.9 million; (b) contributions by
         the Borrower = US$35.9 million; and (c) private funds mobilized by the participating

Economic Efficiency. The Project Appraisal Document computed an financial rate of return (FRR) for the third
component of the project of 49 percent.

The ICR did not compute an FRR or an economic rate of return (ERR) for the project because:

      The PAD had used a "loose set of assumptions" which were "overly optimistic" in calculating the FRR of
       49 percent, raising questions about the credibility of the baseline number (i.e. a project with an 49
       percent FRR implied that the value of the investment would quadruple every 3.5 years).
      The sub-loans provided by the LTFF under the third component of the project, Supporting Long Term
       Finance, which comprised 90 percent of the combined IDA credit and government contribution
       disbursements, were long-term loans with maturities that extended beyond the closing date of this
       operation. Hence, there was no actual data available at closing to compute the ERR or FRR of these
       sub-loans, ex-post.
      Any attempt to compute an ERR of the project at closing would, like at appraisal, use another set of pro-
       forma assumptions, the credibility of which could be similarly contested.

Rather, the ICR (Annex 4, pages 45-53) conducted a "project impact analysis" using surveys of sub-borrowers
and participating financial institutions. The ICR (pages 13-15) concluded that the economic efficiency of the
project was substantial.

      Project sub-borrowers, on average, achieved sales multipliers (ratio of performance in year 3 compared
         to performance in year 1) of 3.9-times and export multipliers of 3.2-times in the first two years after
         borrowing from the LTFF. The sales multipliers were especially impressive, at 20-times, for start-up
         exporters. Additionally, the multipliers were 1.2-times for employment and 1.5-times for fixed assets, on
         average.
        Project sub-borrowers reported an average annual return on fixed assets (at the corporate level) of 10
         percent over 2017-2020.
        Some 91 percent of sub-borrowers considered the LTFF as either highly-effective or effective in
         enhancing their businesses. These sub-borrowers would participate in a similar lending program and
         would recommend the program to their business partners.
        A hundred percent of the participating financial institutions considered the LTFF to have had a strong
         demonstration effect in the development of the long-term finance market and cited the continuing need
         for similar projects, both for financial market liquidity and knowledge transfer effects.
        Following the project, financial institutions, including those that did not participate in the project, started to
         offer foreign-currency loans to exporters at maturities, interest rates, and terms comparable to that
         provided under this project.

Operational Efficiency. Some 87 percent of the IDA credit and 84 percent of the government contribution
were disbursed. The project closed six-months later than originally planned.

Overall Efficiency. This ICR Review acknowledges that actual project data from sub-borrower enterprises are
not available to attempt an ERR or FRR calculation ex-post. The sales and export multiplier numbers provide
credible quantitative evidence of project benefits from the LTFF. The new offering by financial institutions of
term foreign-currency loans to exporters indicate a positive project effect. The efficiency of the project is rated
substantial. This ICR Review recommends a formal ERR or FRR analysis after the long-term loans mature.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Technical Risks. The procurement and installation of IT hardware and software for the financial market
infrastructure was delayed during the early phases of project implementation because of the lack of "special
knowledge of", and "international experience with", the IT/MIS solutions planned for this project, according to
the ICR. Although the IT/MIS packages have since been successfully procured and installed, the technical
risks are likely to persist in the near term as the systems are deployed and operationalized. As during
project implementation, the authorities would need to build up the capacity to competently operate and
manage the financial market infrastructure through contracting for consulting services, the mobilization of
technical advice, and the training of the staff through the transfer and assimilation of knowledge from hired
experts.

Institutional Capacity Risk. Technical assistance, advisory services, and capacity building activities
delivered by this project aimed to strengthen the institutional capacity of Bangladesh Bank, the participating
commercial banks, and the industrial and commercial borrowers to build a more robust long-term
loan market and a more stable financial system. Institutional capacity risks are likely to remain. For the
Bangladesh Bank alone, the remaining agenda is formidable – compliance with the remaining 16 of
the Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructure and the remaining 18 of the Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision of the Basel Committee. The central bank will also have to build up its capacity to
implement AML/CFT monitoring and the know-your-client (KYC) framework for banks, adopt RegTech
(the technology that has been developed for industry to address regulatory challenges) and SupTech (the
technology used by supervisory and regulatory agencies to improve efficiency in their duties overseeing
industry) in the transition to a risk-based supervision system, and ensure the non-disruptive continuity of the
core banking system, among others. Continuing technical assistance in the context of future TA, investment
project, and development policy operations would help address these challenges.

Macroeconomic Risk. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, many participating financial institutions
recorded dramatic drops in new loan issuance and some 70 percent of sub-borrowers reported poorer
business performance from higher operating costs and lower market demand after the onset of COVID-19
pandemic. Following an slowdown to a 3.5 percent growth in fiscal year 2020, including a sharp 18.2
percent real contraction in exports, economic growth is projected to rebound to an annual average 6.7
percent in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, with encouraging prospects for more robust loan demand from
manufacturers and exporters in the near-term. The recovery is subject to downside risks, however, including
from global growth prospects that, at the beginning of 2022, are weaker than previously expected.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  Analytic Foundations. The design of this project was informed by analytic work produced by the Bank
  and other development partners: Bangladesh: Financial System Stability Assessment (IMF, 2009);

                                                                                                    Page 19 of 27

Financial Sector Assessment - Bangladesh (World Bank, 2010); Anti-Money Laundering and Combating
the Financing of Terrorism Mutual Evaluation Report - Bangladesh (Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering, July 2009); IFC Mobile Money Scoping Country Report - Bangladesh (IFC and Switzerland
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, April 2013); FATF Statement - Bangladesh (Financial Action Task
Force International Co-operation Review Group, April 2014); and Review of Credit Reporting Systems
(IFC and DFID, 2014).

According to the PAD (pages 18-19), these studies commonly argued that Bangladesh needed to
improve its financial market infrastructure to facilitate the development of a stable and efficient financial
system for the country. The Bangladesh Bank, as the only credible and available provider of such facility,
needed to build on the existing payments and remittance systems, centralized credit system, securities
settlement system, and financial intelligence system, the platforms for which had been earlier created
with previous assistance from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.K. DFID.
Specifically, the studies called for the Bangladesh Bank to: (a) improve the operational reliability of the
systems; (b) enhance its own capacity to manage the associated IT assets; and (c) integrate the
components of the infrastructure, including with other external systems and the government’s financial
architecture.

Linked Operations. The project development objectives and the project activities were linked to the
objectives and activities of related Bank operations in Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Central Bank
Strengthening Project (P062916), which closed in 2012, aimed to strengthen the capacity of Bangladesh
Bank to act as the country's monetary authority and bank regulator and supervisor, and to enable it to
design and implement a medium- to long-term program for a sound and efficient financial system. With
Bangladesh Bank achieving compliance with four of the 29 BCP principles at the closing of P062916 in
2012, this project would further support the central bank to attain compliance with another eight BCP
principles. The Bangladesh Investment Promotion Financing Facility Projects I (P089382) and II
(P159429), approved in 2006 and 2017 respectively, aimed to increase long-
term financing for infrastructure and to build the capacity of local financial institutions
for promoting private sector‐led infrastructure financing. While these credit operations
focused on infrastructure, they also supported efforts to develop the ecosystem for long-term finance in
Bangladesh, a goal of equal concern to this project.

Stakeholder Consultation. According to the PAD (page 19), the Bank conducted extensive
consultations in the preparation of this project not just with the Ministry of Finance and Bangladesh Bank
but, importantly, with commercial banks, non-bank financial institutions, manufacturers, and exporters
through their industry associations.

Donor Coordination. The Bank and the government collaborated with other development partners in
the design of the project. The first component of this project would build on the "basic platform" for the
financial market infrastructure – the existing payments and remittance systems, securities
settlement system, centralized credit system, and a compliant and integrated financial intelligence system
managed by the Bangladesh Bank – developed earlier with the support of the Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and the U.K. Department for International Development. The second component of
the project would implement the recommendations of the joint IMF and Bank FSAP of 2009-2010 for
Bangladesh Bank to comply with the international standards for banking regulation and supervision set by
the Basel Accords.

  Operational Risk and Mitigation Measures. The Bank assessed the overall operational risk to the
  project to be moderate based on the tested design of the project (in other Bank borrower countries,
  including India, Egypt, and Jordan), the robust project preparation effort expended by Bangladesh Bank,
  and the strong record of Bangladesh Bank in implementing credit-line projects, including having a
  qualified and capable staff for on-lending operations. The PAD (page 15) judged the stakeholder risk,
  arising from a change in leadership at the central bank, to be moderate because the project supported
  the Bangladesh Bank's strategic five-year plan, which was unlikely to be reversed. The PAD also
  assessed the macroeconomic risk to be moderate considering the strong demand for long-term credit by
  exporters and manufacturers. To mitigate risks arising from the operational capacity of the participating
  financial institutions, the Bank proposed: coordination between Bangladesh Bank and private commercial
  banks; coordination between Bangladesh Bank and industry associations representing sub-borrowers,
  including the Manufacturing Exporters Association and the Garment Manufacturing Exporters
  Association; and complementary technical assistance activities to help improve the quality of the loan
  portfolios of the participating financial institutions.

  Design Shortcomings. The Bank over-estimated the number of additional BCP principles for which
  Bangladesh Bank could be judged to be compliant over the six-year duration of this project. Considering
  that Bangladesh Bank had been deemed compliant with only four of the BCP principles after the
  completion of the nine-year Bangladesh Central Bank Strengthening Project in 2012, the target of an
  additional 12 BCP principles was ambitious, subsequently requiring a downward revision at the project
  restructuring in 2019 to more manageable target of eight BCP principles. Moreover, a banking authority's
  compliance with BCP principles could only be assessed under a formal FSAP, which was typically
  conducted by the IMF and the Bank only once every five years.



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 Supervision. The Bank supervised the implementation of the project regularly.

       The Bank conducted seven implementation review missions, filed 11 Implementation Status and
        Results Reports (ISRs) over the six-year duration of this project, about the average two-a-year for
        Bank operations, and filed four Aide Memoires for the implementation support missions and
        technical missions in September 2016, December 2018, May 2019, and November 2020.
       Following the mission in September 2016, the responsibility for implementing the LTFF was
        transferred to the Financial Sector Support Department at Bangladesh Bank from the Foreign
        Reserve and Treasury Management Department, whose mandate did not fit the LTFF lending
        activities. Moreover, the approval process for LTFF sub-loans was streamlined and additional
        training was provided to the Bangladesh Bank staff to help accelerate the approval and
        disbursement of LTFF sub-loans.
       The Bank conducted a mid-term review of the project in March 2018. The mid-term review called
        for expedited disbursements for the technical assistance activities of the project and improvements
        to the quality of safeguards submissions for high-risk sub-loans under the third component.

 Adaptation. The restructuring of the project was appropriate. Changes in some of the results indicators
 and to their targets were warranted: (a) some activities were not part of the project design (compliance with
 the General Principles of Credit Reporting); (b) the funding of some activities were shifted to sources other
 than the World Bank project funds (to the Government’s budget, U.K. DFID, and JCAP); and (c) some
 targets proved ambitious relative to the institutional and implementation capacity of the Bangladesh Bank
 (compliance with 12 principles of the BCP).

 Supervision Shortcomings. The high turnover of Bank task team leaders (there were four task team
 leaders over six years) made supervision challenging, according to the ICR (page 27). It took time for new
 task team leaders to familiarize themselves with the country and the project.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The M&E design called for measuring the achievement of the project objectives with nine output and four
 outcome indicators. The PAD provided definitions and methodologies for the assessment for these results
 indicators (pages 27-30), specified units of measure, baseline values, and annual and end-of-project
 targets (pages 23-26), and identified the data sources and the implementing units responsible for data
 collection (pages 23-26).

 The M&E plan called for the Bangladesh Bank to monitor and evaluate the progress with the project was
 well as with the Governance Accountability and Action Plan. The Bangladesh Bank would prepare project
 reports for each calendar semester and submit the reports to the Bank within forty-five days from the end of
 each reporting period.



b. M&E Implementation
  The Bank introduced changes to the results framework at the first restructuring in October 2019 (see
  Section 2.D), restating one output and two outcome indicators for clarity. As some activities were
  dropped from the project to be financed by other donors and/or other projects, the associated output
  indicators were also deleted from the results framework. In addition, the targets for some outputs and
  outcomes were revised downward, ostensibly, to more realistic numbers, given the pace of
  implementation at restructuring.

  The Bangladesh Bank implemented the M&E according to the original plan, and following the
  restructuring, according to the revised plan.



                                                                                                   Page 22 of 27

c. M&E Utilization
  The M&E data were reported in the Bank ISRs.

  According to the ICR (page 23), the M&E data informed the supervision by the Bank of project
  implementation and the mid-course correction taken by the World Bank at restructuring in October 2019
  and in February 2020. In particular, the M&E data were useful to identify bottlenecks during the early
  phases of project implementation, including the slower than expected pace of disbursements to and from
  the LTFF.



  M&E Quality Rating
  Substantial

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   Environmental and Social Safeguards. The operation was classified as an environmental assessment
   category FI (financial intermediary lending) project at appraisal and triggered safeguard policy OP/BP 4.01 -
   Environmental Assessment. According to the PAD (pages 21-22), the project activities were not expected
   to cause any long-term or irreversible environmental impacts. An Environmental and Social Management
   Framework (ESMF) – the guidelines and procedures for screening, assessing, addressing, and managing
   safeguard issues for project activities – was prepared that met the requirements of the Bank, the
   government, and Bangladesh Bank and published in the Bank's InfoShop and the Bangladesh Bank's
   website in April 2015.

   The ICR (pages 23-24) reported that Bangladesh Bank closely monitored compliance by participating
   financial institutions and by sub-borrowers with the project's environmental and social safeguards review
   procedures. Compliance with the safeguards by participating financial institutions deteriorated after the
   outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, that by sub-borrowers improved, with an increasing
   number able to perform the required environmental tests and conduct the necessary community
   consultations as project implementation progresses. By March 2021, some 27 of the 56 LTFF sub-
   borrowers had obtained their Environmental Clearance Certificates from the Department of Environment as
   required under the Environmental Conservation Act of 1995 and the Environmental Conservation Rules of
   1997 (garments manufacturers were exempt from these rules). Bangladesh Bank submitted the closing
   Report for Environmental and Social Due Diligence to the Bank in March 2021.

   Overall safeguards and compliance with OP/BP 4.01 were rated moderately satisfactory throughout project
   implementation, including in the last ISR of February 2021.

     Financial Sector Support Project (P150938)



b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Procurement. According to the ICR (page 25), lockdowns after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
   slowed down the completion of a couple procurement activities. Some procurement packages were
   dropped entirely from the project for a lack of time for their completion. The dropped procurement
   packages, including for the RISC server, BACH and Bangladesh Automated Cheque Processing System
   (BACPS) software, generator and substation for the disaster recovery site (DRS), and e-Payment
   Gateway, were to be implemented using the budgetary resources of Bangladesh Bank instead.

   Procurement was downgraded from satisfactory to moderately satisfactory in the last ISR of February
   2021, after some procurement packages were not completed and dropped from the project.

   Financial Management. According to the ICR, (pages 24-25), the government and Bangladesh Bank
   complied with the financial management, reporting, and audit requirements for the project. The
   Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division of the Bangladesh Ministry of Planning (IMED), the
   Bangladesh Foreign Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD), and the appointed external accounting and
   audit firm conducted audits annually. Both the interim unaudited financial reports and the audited financial
   statements were submitted to the Bank before the deadline dates. However, there were delays in
   resolving audit observations – of the 18 audit observations issued by FAPAD before fiscal year 2020 (the
   audit for fiscal year 2020 issued an unqualified audit opinion), five remained pending for further discussion.

   Financial management was rated satisfactory throughout project implementation, including in the last ISR
   of February 2021.




c. Unintended impacts (Positive or Negative)
   ---

d. Other
   Gender. The project did not explicitly target women as primary project beneficiaries (owners of private
   firms and borrowers from the LTFF) and no gender-disaggregated data was collected during project
   implementation.

12. Lessons

Three lessons are drawn from the ICR (pages 27-30), with some adaptation.

States can improve their financial market infrastructure and strengthen their banking system
by actively responding to recurring cyber threats against payments systems. The Bangladesh
Bank cyber heist, committed half-a-year after this project started in February 2016, exemplifies the
serious challenges continually faced by the authorities to keep payments systems safe and
secure. Hackers, ostensibly aided by insiders, exploited weaknesses in the central bank's access to
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) global payment network
to illegally transfer US$121 million and attempt to divert another US$850 million from the central
bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to fraudulent accounts in Sri Lanka
and the Philippines. In the context of this and similar projects, investments in cyber security would
tend to be vital parts of programs to upgrade the financial market infrastructure. Additionally,
measures to improve corporate governance and foster ethical behavior among a financial
institution's staff would strengthen efforts to reform banking regulation and supervision.

Strengthening banking regulation and supervision can help states restore financial
soundness after an economic crisis, when economic distress would have invited temporary
regulatory relief. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, into the fifth year of this
project, prompted macro-financial policy responses that made it difficult, at least temporarily, to
install a stricter banking regulation and supervision regime. In addition to liquidity support programs
and interest rates cuts, Bangladesh Bank embarked on a series of regulatory relief measure to help
ease financial conditions at a time of economic distress – the central bank delayed non-performing
loan classifications, relaxed loan rescheduling policies, waived credit card fees, suspended loan
interest payments, relaxed credit risk rating rules for banks, extended the tenures of trade
instruments, and allowed short-term farm loan rescheduling. In actions that negatively affected this
project, the authorities delayed the passage of the amendment to the Bank Company Act and the
issuance of the prompt corrective action circular by Bangladesh Bank. While the regulatory relief
responses were sufficiently justified, the Bangladesh Bank has since started working on a regulatory
relaxation exit strategy that aims to strengthen the banking regulatory and supervisory framework
and reduce financial sector vulnerabilities.

In line of credit operations, streamlining complicated loan approval processes can contribute
to operational efficiency gains. In this project, the ready disbursement of LTFF sub-loans for
sub-projects was derailed by the absence of state budget allocations from the Ministry of Finance,

                                                                                                   Page 25 of 27

       Financial Sector Support Project (P150938)



and when prepared, even these budget allocations had to be cleared by the Department of
Planning. Meanwhile, participating financial institutions that signed loan agreements with sub-
borrowers had to submit project documents to Bangladesh Bank, which reviewed each sub-loan for
compliance with project requirements, including that the sub-loan disbursement was covered by a
state budget allocation. Line of credit operations that utilize state bodies as apex institutions must
invariably follow governmental spending processes and disbursement procedures, which, however,
can turn out to be overly complicated and needlessly bureaucratic. To address this issue, project
planners might design streamlined sub-loan approval processes at appraisal and embed these as
covenants in loan agreements, or alternatively explore using as apex institutions other
intermediaries that were subject to minimal state bureaucratic processes.



13. Assessment Recommended?

  No

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

Consistency with Guidelines. The ICR was prepared consistent with OPCS guidelines on ICRs for investment
project financing operations.

Conciseness. The account of the project's performance is well informed and concisely presented.

Results Orientation. The assessment of efficacy of the project was outcome-oriented and based on the degree
of achievement of the results targets. The assessment of the efficiency of the project was based on a
"project impact analysis" using surveys of the LTFF sub-loan borrowers and the participating financial
institutions, the design and findings of which are detailed and summarized in Annex 4 to the report.

Quality of Evidence. The ICR reinforced its assessment of efficacy with additional information about the
impacts of the project other than those measured by the results indicators.

Quality of Analysis. The assessment of the efficacy of the program was candid. The Bangladesh Bank heist in
2016 lent urgency to the task of upgrading the financial market infrastructure and improving its
management. The economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic posed difficult trade-offs between
sharpening regulation in pursuit of the project objectives and relaxing regulation to ease financial conditions.

Lessons. The lessons are valuable to future projects that aim to develop the financial market infrastructure or
to projects that aim to strengthen the legal framework and the institutional capacity for banking regulation and
supervision. The lessons are also relevant to line of credit operations.
