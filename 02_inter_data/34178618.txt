2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The first program document (PD1) for the programmatic series Laying the Foundation for Inclusive Development
Policy Financing (DPF) in Niger stated that the objectives of the first operation were to (i) reduce gender gaps; (ii)
expand access to electricity and potable water; and (iii) improve debt transparency and debt management
capacity. The project development objective (PDO) of the second operation, as stated in the program document
for the second operation (PD2), was to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic while sowing the seeds
for resilient and faster economic recovery (PD 2, p. 3). The ICR notes that, in contrast to other countries in the
area, Niger did not benefit from a stand-alone COVID-19 crisis response operation. Instead, the adjustments
made during DPF2 were designed to support Niger’s COVID-19 response program (ICR, p. 5).

For the purposes of this ICR Review, the PDOs are taken as:

      PDO1: reduce gender gaps;
      PDO2: protect livelihoods and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while sowing the seeds for
       resilient and faster economic recovery;
      PDO3: expand access to electricity;
      PDO4: expand access to potable water;
      PDO5: improve debt transparency and debt management capacity.

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 28

The pillars were aligned with the PDOs, as defined by the objectives in this ICR review. The pillars of DPF2 did
not change from those of the first DPO, except that Pillar 1 was expanded from "reduce gender gaps" to
“reduce gender gaps and protect livelihoods," taking into account the added support for the COVID-19 response
program.

      Pillar 1. Reduce gender gaps and protect livelihoods;
      Pillar 2. Expand access to electricity and potable water;
      Pillar 3. Improve debt transparency and debt management capacity.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The series consisted of two single-tranche operations totaling US$613.96 million, structured as two IDA
Development Policy Credits and two Development Policy Grants.

The approved amount for the first series was US$350 million, and the disbursed amount was US$351.7 million.
The approved amount for the second series was US$250 million, and the disbursed amount was US$262.3
million. The discrepancies between the approved and disbursed amounts reflect the dollar strengthening
against the Euro over the period.

The first operation was approved on December 12, 2019, became effective on December 18, 2019, and closed
as expected on December 31, 2019. The second was approved on August 6, 2020, became effective on August
31, 2020, and closed as expected on December 31, 2021.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Relevance to country context

 The DPF series was prepared at a time when Niger had experienced strong economic growth, at 5.6 percent
 between 2016 and 2019. However, the country’s high fertility rate suppressed per capita gross domestic
 product (GDP) growth. The country’s population growth rate of 3.9 percent was driven by a fertility rate of 7.1
 children per woman (2018), the highest rate in the world (PD1, p. 58), contributing to rising absolute numbers
 of people living in poverty, and putting “enormous pressure on resources" (PD1, p. 60). The Bank’s Human
 Capital Index ranked Niger 154 out of 157 countries in terms of health/nutrition and education outcomes. By
 supporting the prior actions (PAs) under Pillar 1 to expand educational attainment among girls and reduce
 fertility, the operation “would have a large positive impact on economic growth and poverty reduction” (PD1,
 p. 15). A 2019 World Bank report calculated that, if gender gaps were eliminated, GDP per capita could
 increase by more than a fifth by 2030 (ICR, p. 6).

 Access to electricity and water was “strikingly low.” Just 17 percent of households nationwide and 5 percent
 in rural areas were connected to the electricity grid, and just 43.6 percent of the population had an improved
 water situation. By closing these gaps, the Bank team expected that Niger could generate substantial

development gains. Levels of human capital would improve, and fixing inefficiencies in basic service
infrastructure would deliver economic gains (PD 1, pp. 2-3).

At the time of appraisal, Niger was relatively politically stable, with a government-backed by a strong political
majority since 2016. It was also receiving large-scale donor financing to support its development agenda
(ICR, p. 5). However, a combination of weak governance and public dissatisfaction with public financial
management had put the government under pressure to address a range of financing problems, inefficient
public expenditures, and poor-quality infrastructure (PD 1, p. 61). Total public and publicly guaranteed debt
(as a share of GDP) had increased from 44.6 to 53.8 percent between 2016 and 2018 (PD 1, p. 6). The
conflict and violence engulfing neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso and spilling across Niger’s borders added
to a sense of urgency.

Relevance to Country Partnership Framework and country development strategy

The PDOs were linked to the overarching goal of the FY18-FY22 Country Partnership Framework (CPF)
to safeguard Niger’s economic and social development. PDO 1 aligned with the CPF focus on empowering
women and girls, as part of a “key strategy to reverse Niger’s record high levels of fertility and population
growth” (CPF, p. 1). PDO 2 was consistent with the Bank's COVID‐19 Crisis Response Approach Paper (PD
2, p. 5). PDO 3 aligned directly with the CPF objective of modernizing and diversifying the rural economy
through “ongoing investments in expanding access to on- and off-grid electricity, water supply and sanitation"
(CPF, p. 9). PDO 4 aligned with the CPF’s analysis that Niger’s stock of debt had “risen sharply in recent
years” and with the Bank’s commitment to support the public sector through better access to information and
improved transparency (CPF, p. 28).

The DPF operations aligned with key elements of Niger’s second Economic and Social Development Plan
(PDES II, 2022-2026), which prioritized providing basic social and health services to reduce gender gaps.
The PDES strategic pillar II, “Social Development and the Demographic Transition,” aligned with Pillar I of the
DPF operation. Its pillars III, “Accelerating Economic Growth,” and IV, “Improving Governance, Peace, and
Security," aligned with Pillars II and III of the DPF series (ICR, p. 12).

Under DPF2, the COVID-related policy actions—to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while
sowing the seeds for resilient and faster economic recovery—aligned with the government’s preparedness
and response plan aimed at “managing the health crisis, supporting the resilience of Niger’s economy,
protecting the livelihoods of the poor vulnerable, and mitigating the economic impacts of the pandemic” (ICR,
p. 12).


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The two operations had a total of 20 prior actions (PAs) under the three reform pillars. For the purposes of
this ICR Review, IEG has renumbered the prior actions from PD1 and PD2 so that they are grouped by
objective.

                                                    New: PA20 is new and added during DPF2 in response
                                                    to COVID-19.

The program documents (PD1 and PD2) provided a clear, detailed rationale for every PA and the expected
results. The ICR’s theory of change depicted how the activities would contribute to program outcomes and
goals. However, in some areas, it is not clear that the PA would lead to sustainable outcomes. This is
particularly the case for the PAs focused on reducing gender gaps, for reasons explained below.

PDO 1: Reduce gender gaps

The first objective had three PAs under DPF1 and two under DPF 2 that addressed the impacts of early
marriage. The combined actions fit with a multi-faceted government strategy to address multiple drivers of
child marriage considered critical for promoting “adolescent girls’ empowerment and their access to quality
reproductive, child, and maternal health services” (ICR, p. 26). By aiming to reduce high fertility rates
linked to child marriage, the actions directly addressed the PDES II social development and demographic
transition strategic priority.

    Niger First DPO Series 2020 (P169830)



PA1 PA2 and PA3 were relevant to the first objective by seeking to change community behavior and attitudes
toward child marriage through broad participation. In Niger, the median age for marriage of girls is 15.7 years,
about nine years earlier than for boys, and in the regions of Zinder and Maradi, child marriage prevalence
was 88 percent in 2017 (PD1, p. 16). The CPC, a community structure representing all sectors in the
community and involving community members, was an appropriate structure, given “the intergenerational
consequences for those involved and born from [child] marriage as well as for the whole community” (PD1,
pp. 15-16). PD1 also noted that “child marriage takes place primarily under customary or religious laws and
tackling it requires a major shift in norms and attitudes from families and communities.” The PAs
institutionalized mechanisms to achieve consensual decisions within communities to abandon child marriage,
with the CPCs becoming formal and legally recognized entities with a mandate to "obtain commitments from
religious and traditional leaders to abandon child marriage practices" (PD1, p. 19). CPCs included both
female and male elected representatives, medical staff, community members, and teachers, in addition to
religious and traditional leaders, and they were to work closely with development partners and non-
governmental organizations. According to the ICR, the CPCs were designed to target “a wide audience
(including husbands, wives, teenage boys, and girls) and adopt a roadmap of interventions to raise
awareness around key topics including child marriage and teenage reproductive health” (p. 26). PAs 1-
3 built on the experience of community-based approaches used by the Sahel Women's Empowerment and
Demographic Dividend project (2015-2024, US$304 million) and relied on that project to achieve “tangible
impacts” in the area. The relevance of PA1, PA2, and PA3 are thus all rated Satisfactory.

PA4 was relevant because it would increase the autonomy of young married women over their reproductive
choices, while addressing a constraint to schooling created by unwanted pregnancy. The ICR (p. 17) notes
that nearly half of women ages 15-19 do not used modern contraception because of opposition from a
husband or parent. The Ministerial order would, if well-publicized, signal the government’s endorsement of
married adolescent girls’ rights to health, safety, and agency. (However, there is no mention of how the
decree would be enforced and no guarantee that it would be well-publicized.) By reducing fertility at a young
age, the action would enable them to obtain more years of education and improve their opportunities in the
labor market, thereby reducing the gender gap and increasing human capital, objectives in line with the
FY18-FY22 CPF and PDES II strategic priorities. PA4 is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

PA5 would replace a legal disposition that “excluded girls from school permanently if they were married and
temporarily if they were pregnant” (ICR, p. 17). The action was relevant in that it would i) reduce the chances
of girls leaving school and ii) increase years of schooling, and thus future work opportunities, for girls in this
category. The PA was to be accompanied by disciplinary measures imposed on school principals or teachers
if they refused to reinstate girls returning to school after childbirth. It was at least partly dependent on a joint
circular letter signed by the three ministries responsible for education defining and clarifying the sanctions.
PA5 is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

PDO 2: Protect Livelihoods and Mitigate the Impact of COVID-19 while Sowing the Seeds for Resilient
and Faster Economic Recovery

PA6 (alleviating the impacts of the COVID- 19 pandemic on poor and vulnerable population through
implementation of the Cash Transfer Program) was added to DPF2 to address negative impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic by using the existing safety net coverage to support vulnerable households
through cash transfers. In the context of the pandemic and economic crises, the inclusion of PA6 was
relevant and thus rated Satisfactory.

PDO 3: Expand Access to Electricity

PA7 promoted access to electricity by improving the regulatory environment that covers “all salient priorities
of the electrification strategy – rural areas, off-grid electrification, renewables, and private sector participation”
(ICR, p. 18). In order to expand access to low-density rural areas in a cost-effect manner, off-grid solutions
(which are mostly based on renewable energy) are needed. To incentivize independent power producers to
bid for off-grid energy tenders, the regulatory framework had to be revised, Niger’s electricity access rates
were ranked among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, with only five percent of rural households (which
represent 80 percent of the population) having access to modern electricity services in 2016 (PD1, p. 22).
The prior action would support the government’s target of increasing rural access to electricity tenfold by
2021 (PDES 2017-2021). The government and the Bank expected the PA to stimulate private sector
investments, in part by mitigating the “perceived and actual risks of such investment by clarifying the rural
concession process, buy-out options in case the national grid expands to the concession areas, and
incentives to support investment" (PD1, p. 23). PA7 complemented existing regulations. The relevance of
PA7 is rated Satisfactory.

PA8 is relevant because a grid code was necessary to allow access of third parties to the transmission
networks and the integration of renewables generation. The ICR states that “The code is important in the
context of the wider ECOWAS regional electricity market, where regional interconnectors had emerged and
defines the technical specifications for third-party power producers to connect to the national grid” (ICR p.
18). The code outlines technical specifications and aligns with the West African Power Pool (WAPP) regional
grid code (PD1, pp. 23-24). Combined with commissioning new electricity infrastructure and integration of
renewable energy, this PA would further facilitate private sector participation. For Niger to reach its goal of 30
percent electrification derived from renewable sources (solar and hydro) by 2030, a change in the energy mix
to diversify energy sources was critical, and the grid code was “important in the context of the wider…regional
electricity market, where regional interconnectors had emerged” (ICR, p. 18). The relevance of PA8 is rated
Satisfactory.

PA9 and PA10 were designed to facilitate electricity access by improving utility performance and fostering
private sector investment, thus “alleviating public spending constraints" faced by the government (PD1, p.
22). PA9 (approving the performance contract entered between the government and Société Nigeriene
D’Electricite to improve service quality and key performance indicators of the electricity sector and increase
the share of renewable energies in the energy mix) is relevant in that the performance contract, if
implemented, would “(a) improve electricity service quality; (b) set the obligations of the government and the
utility to achieve performance targets; and (c) raise the share of renewables in the energy mix“ (ICR, p, 18).
The relevance of PA9 is rated Satisfactory.

PA10 would establish “clear, transparent, competitive and simple IPP [independent power producers]
procurement process and modalities in the power sector using international best practices” (PD 2, p. 32). This
PA addressed concerns about transparency in IPP management; an earlier World Bank analysis had found
that the costs of power procured through negotiated contracts represented a 30 percent mark-up over the
presumed cost of production (PD2, pp. 31-32). The mark-up is not unexpected, given low levels of
competition among IPPs for contracts in rural areas. The PA was intended to stimulate private investment by
improving the procurement process for IPPs, leading to the award of competitive contracts that would add
40 MWp in new solar capacity and connect 5,000 new households. The relevance of PA10 is rated
Satisfactory.

PDO 4: Expand Access to Potable Water

PA11 would facilitate tariff adjustments "to account for water use under climate shocks (ex. droughts) to help
with the management of consumption”, while creating a framework to encourage private sector actor
participation in the sector, enabling network expansion (PD1, pp. 26-27). PD1 notes that a previous
regulatory authority, the Multi-Sector Regulatory Authority, had been key to the sector’s success largely due
to its independence from the sector ministry and the two state water enterprises (SEEN, in charge of
commercial activities and facility maintenance, and SPEN, which manages assets and investments in the
sector). That previous regulator had been dissolved in 2012, with no effective regulator in place since then.
The newly constituted independent regulator would ensure cooperation between sector stakeholders by, for
example, creating a mechanism to address issues as they arise. Such a mechanism might consist of having
rules in place to have gov’t clear arrears to distribution utility on a regular basis. PA14 was relevant because
it operationalized the water regulatory authority established by PA11. Therefore, PA11 and PA14 are rated
Satisfactory.

PA12 aligned with the government’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Sectoral Program (Programme Sectoriel
Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement, PROSEHA 2016-2030). The agreement “would transfer 75 fast-growing
rural centers to the jurisdiction of SPEN to provide potable water to 1.3 million customers, an important focus
considering the low rate of access to water in rural areas.” PA13 (payment of arrears due to SEEN and the
overdue balance to SPEN up to April 2020) was relevant because, in the absence of an effective regulator,
significant cross-debt and arrears had accumulated between the entities involved in sector management. A
tripartite debt-cycle arrangement was in place, whereby the water distribution company (SEEN) was in debt
to the water asset company (SPEN), which in turn was in debt to the government. SEEN's cash flow had
deteriorated, and it faced difficulties fulfilling its financial obligations in its leasing arrangements with SPEN
and SPEN therefore could not service its debts. PA13 would restore financial equilibrium to the water sector
entities that households depend on, while also making private sector participation possible. PA12 and PA13
are rated Moderately Satisfactory.

PA15 facilitated access to potable water in the concession areas, addressing the problem of very low access
in rural areas, of just 18 percent in 2016 (PDES II). The application of the code was considered important in
that it reflected West African Economic and Monetary Union directives and standards to ensure “a
competitive and transparent approach to investment in the sector” (ICR, p. 19). PA 15 is rated Satisfactory.

PDO 5: Improve debt transparency and debt management capacity

Debt management

PA16 was relevant because it addressed several weaknesses, including an ad hoc budgeting process, rather
than one based on a medium-term strategy; no clear division of responsibilities over debt operations; and
overlapping roles by various debt management departments. These weaknesses had been outlined in a 2013
Debt Management Performance Assessment. The Bank and government identified centralizing debt
managing authority and responsibilities as crucial “due to overlapping of roles, lack of coherent information
flows, and severe operational risks" (ICR, Table 6, pp. 34-35). PA16 is rated Satisfactory.

Debt transparency

PA17, PA18 and PA19 were relevant because they mandated making debt information public. Debt data on
public private partnerships and state-owned enterprises were not previously included in the reporting of the
debt analytical report. Significant fiscal risks linked to state-owned enterprises (SOEs)—which have access to

                                                                                                     Page 11 of 28

 commercial credit and have recourse to short-term debt guaranteed by the state—made oversight critical
 (PD1, p. 30). PA 17, PA 18, and PA 19 are rated Satisfactory.

 PA20 was relevant as a policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PA, which was new and added to
 DPF2 in response to the pandemic, did two things. First, it waived certain water and electricity service
 payments by eligible households to the respective utilities. Second, it refunded both utilities via transfer
 mechanism from the budget to protect them from accumulating arrears and from further indebtedness. The
 ICR notes that, in addition to supporting households during the pandemic, this was a mechanism by which
 the financial costs of the water and electricity subsidies to poor households and their associated fiscal costs
 to the government would become more transparent (ICR, p. 20), although it does not explain how. In addition,
 elimination of arrears falls short of arrears prevention which is the longer-run objective. Finally, the PA is not
 related to debt transparency objective. The PA is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

      Niger First DPO Series 2020 (P169830)



RI1: Share of targeted communes that have a Child Protection Committee, was to capture the impact
of PA1, PA2, PA3.

RI1 measured the number of CPCs established at the commune level. Although PA1 called for establishing a
structure of CPCs at multiple levels, the indicator relates only to CPCs within communes (implying that they
must be village-level CPCs). This focus makes sense, since the village-level CPC, unlike CPCs at higher levels,
engages directly with village members. The operations team informed IEG that indicator formulation “have a
CPC” means that CPC members are designated in the commune, i.e. sanctioned by a local authority act. The
PD and ICR do not explain why only 170 out of 265 communes were targeted, or how they would be chosen.
Project documents do not mention whether the targeted communes had high early marriage rates, but the
project team noted they were indeed prioritized for this reason. The ICR also points out attribution issues with
RI1 given the close link between the DPL series and the Sahel Women’s Empowerment and
Demographics Dividend (SWEDD) Project (2014-2024) but at the same time the complementarity between the
DPL and the IPF is considered a positive factor that increases the chance of an operation’s success. Most
importantly, the RI measured only implementation of the PA; it did not measure outcomes farther down the
results chain related to the objective of reducing gender gaps. RI1: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI2: Share of family planning demand met for adolescent girls aged 15-19, was to capture the impact
of PA4.

RI2 was relevant to the PA because it measured demand for family planning for adolescent girls, which is seen
as a proxy indicator for reducing fertility. It was for a specific age and had a baseline, although it did not describe
how data would be collected. The operations team explained that “demand for family planning” was measured
by asking female respondents if they had family planning needs which could not be satisfied. Individual
responses were thereafter aggregated for relevant interest groups including teenage girls between the ages 15
and 19. As such, a demand for family planning ratio of 34.9 percent means that this share of teenage girls
reported having family planning needs which they could not satisfy. However, the original baseline used by the
operation, of 34.9 percent, was from 2011, and therefore cannot be considered appropriate, as the actual level
of demand for family planning at the time of appraisal was not known. The baseline was revised to 33.1 percent
for 2018, and the RI target was revised downward for DPF2 from 45 percent to 38 percent. The new baseline
represented a decline over seven years by 1.8 percent (from 34.9 to 33.1 percent between 2011 and 2018),
while the estimate for 2021 of 38.1 percent was an approximate measure derived using data from the 2021
ENAFEME survey and applying simple assumptions, as per the ICR (p. 27). It Because an actual baseline was
not available for the share of family planning demand at the time of DPF, it is unclear a) how a target could have
been set; and b) what impact the DPL might have had. For example, demand might well have been trending up
for several years preceding the DPL, and in theory could have already met the target by the time the project was
designed. RI2: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

RI3: Share of adolescent girls aged 15-19 who are married and mothers in school system, was to capture
the impact of PA5.

RI3 was directly related to the government decree allowing this group of students to continue. However, the ICR
notes that the RI was flawed and difficult to measure, both at implementation and at closing, and relied on
several assumptions. The indicator was “not part of the government’s data production system and was
estimated at baseline using several surveys” (ICR, p. 43). To arrive at the estimate, the ICR used an
approximate range based on 2021 Enquête Nationale sur la Fécondité et la Mortalité (ENAFEME) survey data.
The ICR also noted the short time frame of two years, and that more time would be needed to measure the

effect of the prior action. With no reliable on information on what the share of girls in school was at appraisal, it is
difficult to determine what impact the operation had. RI3: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for Objective 2. Protect livelihoods and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
while sowing the seeds for resilient and faster economic recovery

RI4: Number of poor and vulnerable beneficiary households receiving COVID‐19 response cash transfer,
was to capture the impact of PA6.

RI4 was relevant to PA6, which aimed to alleviate the impact of the pandemic on the poor. IEG concurs with the
ICR that the target was set very low, at 30,000 (from a baseline of 0), representing just 8 percent of the 400,000
names in the database of poor households who regularly benefit from the social safety net. While assisting
poor and vulnerable households during the COVID crisis was critical, no policy reforms were introduced that
would “sow the seeds for resilience” in the case of future economic shocks and faster economic recovery. As the
ICR notes, mechanisms to efficiently support vulnerable households during these types of crises are critically
needed (ICR, p. 38). RI4: Moderately Satisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for PDO 3: Expand access to electricity

RI5: Share of new mini grid electricity connections created of the 2025 target (25,000 connections), was
to capture the impact of PA7.

RI5 replaced the DPF1 target “share of new power connections for targeted households in rural areas that
access mini-grid electricity” to provide more clarity. "Share” refers to the target of 25,000 new households
connected by 2025. The private sector was instrumental in the provision of solar voltaic mini-grids that would
play an important role if Niger were to meet rural electrification targets (PD1, p. 24). The RI was relevant to the
government’s goal of increasing access to electricity in rural areas. RI5: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI6 and RI7: Generation capacity contracted for solar energy, and IPP contracts awarded on a sole
source basis and/or without cost-benefit analysis, were to capture the impact of PA7, PA8, PA9, and PA10.

RI6 and RI7 measured the ability to connect households to electricity by expanding capacity to meet the
government’s goal of total capacity of solar plants generating about 90 MWp. Because these would be built by
private developers, public spending would largely be unaffected. By measuring contracted energy capacity, RI6
was a clear and measurable indicator in megawatt hours/year capacity of new plants. RI7 for IPP contracts
awarded was clear and easily measurable. However, the ICR notes that RI7 (IPP contracts awarded on a sole
source basis and/or without cost-benefit analysis) did not identify whether new inefficient IPPs were bid and
rejected, which would allow the Bank to better assess the impacts of the reform on private participation. RI6 and
RI7: Moderately Satisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for PDO 4: Expand access to potable water

RI8: Turnover of SPEN, was to measure the impact of PA12, PA13, and PA14.

RI8 was indirectly linked to the viability of the water utility, but it did not directly measure the effect of any of the
prior actions on a regulatory framework linked to water utilities. The ICR reports that RI8 replaced “Net income
(after tax) of SPEN, CFAF” in DPF1 since the tariff revision expected in 2020 was postponed due to the
pandemic (ICR, p. 21). The ICR questions whether “turnover of SPEN” was too aggregate to be attributed
largely to the PAs being supported, noting that “macroeconomic factors (e.g., annual economic growth) and

                                                                                                           Page 17 of 28

water market developments, among other factors, could drive the turnover as much as the reform measures”
(ICR, p. 22). The project team justified use of the indicator on the basis that only utilities in a state of financial
equilibrium can finance their investments through their own budgets. RI8: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

RI9: Previously unserved beneficiaries with access to potable water in targeted rural centers, was to
measure the impact of PA15.

RI9 was relevant to the prior action which sought to accelerate access to water in underserved areas most at
risk of secondary water‐borne impacts, by SPEN (the water company) entering contracts to expand access to
drinking water in its concession perimeters. The impact of the prior action would lead to more
households accessing potable water. The ICR notes that there are attribution issues with RI9 because another
DPF series, the Niger Urban and Water Sanitation Project (2011-2020), was focused on addressing the same
issue. RI9: Moderately Satisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for PDO 5: Improve debt transparency and debt management capacity

RI10, RI11, RI12: Published annual borrowing plan includes a cost/risk analysis of the debt portfolio,
share of SOEs complying with debt reporting, and share of SOEs publishing financial statements,
percent, was to measure the impacts of PA17, PA18, and PA19.

RI10 was a yes/no indicator on whether the published annual borrowing plan included a cost/risk analysis of the
debt portfolio tied to the Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for 2021-2023. The Bank and the government
considered a published annual borrowing plan critical to improving transparency in budget management and
reducing the risks created by PPPs and state-owned enterprises. While RI10 does not measure the impact of a
particular prior action, it does measure risks associated with low transparency. A cost/risk analysis takes into
account debt projections based on fluctuating market conditions, allowing for mitigation measures to be built into
the plan. RI10 replaced “Borrowing plan including a cost/risk analysis of the debt portfolio” in DPF1 to
emphasize the expected publication of the report online. RI10: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI11 and RI12 measured the number of public sector entities (SOEs and PPPs) that reported their debt (RI11)
and published financial statements (RI12). By measuring the share of SOEs and PPPs, the indicators ensured
that a substantial number of entities whose financial management and debt had implications for fiscal debt would
be publicly accountable. A better indicator, in terms of fiscal impact, would have measured the share of total
debt of all entities being reported, rather than just the share of entities. However, given that the debt amounts
are probably unknown (hence the need for these prior actions), the indicators can be considered adequate. RI11
and RI12: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI13: A budget line to compensate utility companies for COVID‐related spending for poor and vulnerable
households, CFAF billion, was to measure the impact of PA20.

RI13 measured whether a budget line was included to compensate utility companies for COVID‐related
spending for poor and vulnerable households. As the ICR found, the indicator was not needed for capturing the
impact of the PA, however, since compensation to utilities was made even though no separate budget line was
introduced, and other budget sources were used. On top of this, the indicator was a risky choice, because “in the
context of program budgeting…new budget lines are often difficult to introduce” (ICR, p. 22) The indicator could
have been linked more appropriately to PDO4 – mitigating the Covid pandemic effects. RI13: Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

               Objective
               Reduce gender gaps [PAs 1-5, RIs 1-3]

               Rationale
               RI1: The goal of having CPCs in 30% of the targeted communities was achieved. The ICR reports that 50
               communes (out of the target of 170) and 508 villages had CPCs in 2021. The achievement was made
               possible in part through SWEDD, the complementary Bank project, although there is no clarity on the relative
               roles of this DPF versus SWEDD. However, no evidence was available on whether the CPCs, even if the
               target was met, had an effect on closing the gender gap. With the relevance of the RI moderately satisfactory,
               the achievement rating is High.

               RI2: As per the ICR, the indicator “share of demand for family planning” almost met the target, as it increased
               from 33.1 percent at the baseline to 38.1 percent by closing. This was just below the target of 39 percent.
               However, with the relevance of the RI moderately unsatisfactory, this does not constitute sufficient evidence
               of progress toward the objective and in the absence of additional evidence, the achievement rating is
               downgraded to Modest.

               RI3: No direct data for measuring the number or share of adolescent girls aged 15-19 who were married and
               mothers and remained in school was available. Furthermore, the baseline was from 2006, long before
               program effectiveness. Instead, data from the 2021 ENAFEME survey was used, and some “simple
               assumptions” were applied, according to the ICR (p. 27). These undefined assumptions led the ICR to
               estimate a result of between 3.8 and 8.3 percent, and select a mid-point of 6.1 percent by 2021, compared to
               a target of 10.0 percent. This reported result represents modest achievement, but with the relevance of the RI
               moderately unsatisfactory, it does not constitute evidence of progress toward the objective and in the
               absence of additional evidence the achievement rating is downgraded to Negligible.

               With one RI substantially achieved, one modestly achieved and one negligibly achieved, this objective is
               rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Protect livelihoods and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while sowing the seeds for resilient
and faster economic recovery [PA 6; RI 4]

Rationale
RI4: This indicator, added to DPF2, covered the number of poor and vulnerable beneficiary households
receiving COVID‐19 response cash transfers. The target of 30,000 was exceeded, for reasons described
above, with 523,461 receiving transfers. Achievement is rated High.

With one RI highly achieved, this objective is rated Satisfactory.

OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
Increase access to electricity [PAs 7-11; RIs 5-7]

Rationale
RI5: The target of reaching 20 percent of the share of new connections to mini-grid electricity was only
partially achieved, at 10 percent (2439 of the long-term goal of 25,000). Achievement is rated Modest.

RI6: The target for 40 megawatts peak (MWp) of capacity was not achieved. No progress was made, as at
closing only 7 megawatts peak (MWp) of capacity, the same as at baseline, was online. This was due
to delays in the Niger Gorou Banda Scaling Solar Project, a 50 MWp solar photovoltaic power plant.
Achievement is rated Negligible.

RI7: No IPP contracts were awarded on a sole source basis and/or without cost-benefit analysis by closing
because, meeting the target of zero (although, as the ICR reports, no IPP contracts were awarded at all in
2020 and 2021 (ICR, p. 28). The reason given by the ICR is that the regulatory reforms that made tenders
more competitive acted as a disincentive to IPPs to bid. Achievement is rated Substantial.

With one RI rated substantial, one modest and one negligible, this objective is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

RI8: Turnover of the SPEN increased from CFAF 4.7 billion at baseline to CFAF 5.1 billion by
closing, substantially achieving the target of CFAF 5.5 billion. While it is clear that a financially stable water
utility is essential for ensuring household access to water, it is not clear how a certain turnover amount
impacts expanding access, only that a viable utility reduces the chances that households will lose access.
Achieving the result indicator would thus set the company on a path enabling investments in the sector.
Achievement is downgraded to Modest.

RI9: Thanks in part to the concurrent Niger Urban and Water Sanitation Project, the number of unserved
beneficiaries with access to potable water in targeted rural centers reached 1,130,000 by closing, exceeding
the target of 550,000. Unlike the electricity access target, the high number of households with access
represent a substantial share of the total population without access and are in excess of annual newly formed
households. The target is also likely easier to reach, since to meet the criterion “access to potable water” an
individual household connection is not necessary. Achievement is rated High.

With one RI highly achieved and one modestly achieved, this objective is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

OBJECTIVE 5
Objective
Improve debt transparency and debt management capacity [PAs 16-20, RIs 10-13]

Rationale
RI10: The indicator was changed from “borrowing plan including a cost/risk analysis of the debt portfolio” to
“published annual borrowing plan includes a cost/risk analysis of the debt portfolio” in order to emphasize the
expected publication of the report online. The report was published by the government in 2021, achieving the
target. Achievement is rated High.

RI11: The share of SOEs complying with debt reporting requirements reached 28 percent by closing, which
was well below the target of 75 percent. However, the list of SOEs reporting included nine of the 11 largest
SOEs, partly mitigating the low achievement in absolute terms (but also raising the question of whether the
indicator should have been linked to SOE size). The ICR reports that, in addition, the government published a
debt analysis report for 2021 that included information on PPPs and on-lending by the government to three

                  30). Achievement is rated Modest.

                  RI12: The share of SOEs that published financial statements was 28 percent, below the target of 50 percent.
                  RI12 is closely linked to RI11 in that the same 10 SOEs that reported their debt published financial
                  statements, as per the ICR (pp. 29-30). Achievement is rated Modest.

                  RI13 called for a budget line in fiscal year 2021 to compensate the utility companies SEEN and NIGELEC for
                  their COVID-19-related spending for poor and vulnerable households. No budget line was added, but the
                  utilities were compensated regardless, through other budget sources. It turned out that a budget line was not
                  required, and therefore the indicator may not have had an impact. Achievement is rated Negligible.

                  With one RI highly achieved, two modestly achieved, and one negligibly achieved, this objective is rated

6. Outcome

Rationale

The satisfactory rating for relevance of PAs was based on their generally sound design, with a clear results
chain connecting the PAs to achievement of the objectives. On the other hand, several PAs seem to have been
based on assumptions that did not bear out. One was that social norms and behavior (for closing the gender

gap) could be changed in a short period of time by passing decrees. Achieving these aims is more likely to
depend on longer-term interventions.

The moderately satisfactory rating for efficacy stems, in part, from somewhat uncertain progress on closing the
gender gap, which may have been a tall order for a two-operation DPL series, even with TA from
a complementary program. IEG notes that changing behavior and social norms is a long process, and as such
was most probably an overly ambitious goal for the operation, but also acknowledges that the operation has
taken steps which should help move things in the right direction on this front.

With satisfactory relevance of PAs, moderately satisfactory efficacy, the Outcome is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.


a. Rating

Moderately Satisfactory

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Women’s empowerment risk. There is a significant risk that the series will not have a lasting impact on gender
gaps. As the ICR notes, CPCs risk becoming “obsolete once the SWEDD project expires” (ICR, p. 37).
Furthermore, the ICR points to the risk that the government will shift the burden of monitoring and oversight of
the CPCs to other partners who may well not have sufficient resources for these tasks. The sustainability of the
reform overall is in question, since the government’s only other significant measure to empower women is the
construction of boarding schools.

Water utility sustainability risk. The ICR notes that the DPF series’ success in restoring financial equilibrium
of the water sector, by clearing accumulated arrears between the government and the water utilities SEEN and
SPEN, was temporary. A risk arises should government not raise tariffs as intended. The government missed
the first deadline of January 2022, and in the meantime, arrears have accumulated again, partially undoing the
effect of the PA. The ICR cites a high inflationary environment as an additional risk factor, since the hardship
imposed by overall rising prices will discourage the government from moving forward with tariff adjustments
(ICR, p. 37). The overall effect is to weaken the financial sustainability of the water sector, thus inhibiting its
ability to expand access to the population.

Energy sector risk. Energy sector regulatory reforms brought Niger closer to compliance with international
norms on competitiveness. However, this had the unintended side effect of making bids more costly, effectively
reducing IPPs from participating in tenders. Further reforms also create a risk that, as the ICR notes, the
regulatory reforms will “pave the way for the selection of potentially costly and inefficient IPPs” (ICR, pp. 37-38).

SOE transparency risk. The ICR concludes that PA to strengthen financial reporting by SOEs is unlikely to be
sufficient to embed this practice in future. The fact that reports were not published in 2022 is a worrying sign.
The ICR concludes that additional measures will be needed if the practice is to continue (ICR, p. 38).

Livelihoods risk. As noted, the COVID-19 assistance measures were a stopgap rather than a reform of the
social benefits distribution mechanism, via, for example, the consolidation and verification of the various lists of
beneficiaries in use. In other words, PA6 was a bandage when surgery is required in the longer term. Therefore,
while the response to the COVID pandemic is concrete, the impact of the operation on future resilience is

unclear. The risk to the economy and to the vulnerable from future economic shocks—which the ICR
characterizes as “inevitable” and “a substantial risk to rural incomes, particularly with sub-optimal risk-coping
mechanisms” (ICR, p. 38)—remains much as before. At the same time, PD2 notes that multiple additional
government support programs were put in place as part of an overall response plan, in the amount of US$ 2.5
billion, to increase the economy’s resilience. They included pandemic health management, education
system resilience, a support plan for vulnerable populations, economic and financial impact mitigation, and
agropastoral producer resilience measures (PD2, p. 65). The government’s response to COVID‐19 is part of a
broader strategy for establishing a response mechanism to shocks, which is one of the pillars of adaptive social
protection (PD2, p. 68).




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Lessons from prior experience:

IEG mostly agrees with the ICR's conclusion that the operations' analytical underpinnings were strong. DPF
design drew in part on the 2017 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and related consultations. The ICR's
Table 6 (pp. 33-35) lays out the specific WBG analytical work supporting each PA. However, some of the studies
underlying the design of some PAs were only indirectly relevant. For example, PAs 1-3, focused on closing
gender gaps, were based on a 2018 study about the opportunity costs of gender inequality. There was no
analysis of the effectiveness of CPCs in encouraging communities to promote girls' education, or how realistic is
it to expect social norms to change over a short period of time and driven externally, as was the case with CPCs.
Similarly, the 2019 Public Expenditure Review was cited to support the PA on cash transfers. These types of
studies make the case for outcomes, e.g., closing gender gaps yields benefits, and cash transfers shield
vulnerable households, but not a case for methods: how can these reforms be supported such that the
outcomes are sustainable?

Results chain:

PD1 discusses a “Theory of Change on Child Marriage” (PD1, p. 16) and notes how the three relevant PAs fit
into its logic. It makes a good case that social norms are a critical factor in early marriage among girls, while also
noting that rates are significantly higher in Niger than in the broader Sahel sub-region. The ICR (Figure 1)
presents a “theory of change” for DPF1 that describes how each PA was expected to contribute to the program
objectives, via outputs and outcomes. The ICR refers to the theory of change in its discussion of these PAs but
does not otherwise outline the linkages in narrative form. The theory of change is limited to and thus does not
cover the fourth objective of “mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 while sowing the seeds for resilient and
faster economic recovery.” However, IEG recognizes that the Bank was under significant pressure to identify
measures to counteract the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic in a short time with limited options and
constrained capacity.

      Niger First DPO Series 2020 (P169830)



Risk identification and mitigation:

The first operation focused on political and governance risks, macroeconomic risks, fiduciary risks, and other
risks related to climate, disaster, and security, rating the overall risk “substantial” (ICR, p. 35). PD1 mentions
absorptive capacity risks, but according to the TTL this related to technical capacity rather than fiduciary risks.
PD2 focused on the pandemic risks, macroeconomic risks, program technical design risks, stakeholder
risks (around cultural beliefs), and fiduciary risks. It rated all these substantial. IEG concurs with the ICR that the
Bank assessed the “overall risk of the operation correctly as substantial.”

Stakeholder consultation and coordination with development partners:

PD1 (p. 33) refers to 2016 consultations with stakeholders for the development of the SCD, which informed the
development of the first operation in the series. It also notes that regular consultations were held with the
government, the European Union, and the African Development Bank on the budget support framework (PD1, p.
34). For the CPCs, PD2 refers to consultations under the leadership of the government, including a
workshop attended by international and local non-governmental organizations and international agencies, on
DPF reforms and the approach to addressing child marriage. The ICR reports that the Bank’s close dialogue
with the government, its support throughout the operation, and “strong coordination with the International
Monetary Fund and other stakeholders acted as mitigating factors by helping the government to maintain the
momentum of structural reforms (ICR, p. 36). The Bank designed the DPF to be implemented in coordination
with investment projects, including the Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend Project
(SWEDD), Niger Electricity Access Expansion Project, Niger Solar Electricity Project, Water Sector Project, and
Urban Water and Sanitation Project.



Rating

Moderately Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

The ICR finds that “the M&E framework of operation and inter-ministerial coordination during implementation
could have been stronger” (ICR, p. 36). It reached this conclusion based on difficulties in tracking down data for
some indicators (even eight months after program completion), on a weak inter-governmental coordination
mechanism during program implementation, and on the Bank’s inadequate supervision of reform implementation
when it came to the budget line to compensate utilities and to extended publication of the SOE financial
statements. On the other hand, the Bank did carry out regular supervision, conducted via sector specialists
working on investment projects, and it coordinated with the IMF and other partners (ICR, pp. 36-37).

Adaptation

The Bank responded to the economic threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating two new prior
actions into DPF2. PA6 was designed to strengthen the government’s ability to alleviate the impacts of the

COVID-19 pandemic on the poor and vulnerable population through the use of existing cash transfer programs.
PA20 sought to protect the financial viability of SEEN and NIGELEC during the crisis.

Appropriate adjustments were made to the results framework, although shortcomings remained with some
results indicators. Four indicative triggers (2,3, 4 and 9) were dropped. PA7 replaced IT4. Several others were
changed. IT5 was reformulated. IT6 and IT7 were merged and strengthened into PA9, and IT10 was split into
PA12 and PA19. The baseline for RI2 (share of family planning demand met for adolescent girls aged 15-19)
was revised downward from 34.9 percent to 33 percent, ostensibly to reflect better data, though the data
were still based on estimates. RI8 was changed from net income to turnover, which measured impacts beyond
the scope of the supported operations.

12. Lessons

IEG concurs with the lessons outlined in the ICR and adds the following lessons:

Reform outcomes from one-off prior actions are less sustainable when government ownership is weak
and complementary ongoing activities cannot be counted upon. A key message that emerges from the
lessons outlined in the ICR concerns sustainability. Many of the reforms promoted through the operation's PAs
are at risk of reversal following the program’s closure. The DPF series was dependent on other projects to
further its objectives in addressing the gender gap and in expanding electricity and water access to households,
and only the last met its indicator target. The assumption that passing a law or decree will lead to change is
implicitly questioned by the ICR.

     Niger First DPO Series 2020 (P169830)



A DPF series may not be the right instrument for changing social norms. IEG questions the rationale for
using a DPF series to promote new social norms and behavior change, in this case attitudes toward pregnant or
married girls attending school. A top-down approach, via decrees to set up a CPC system and village-level
CPCs, with reliance on other programs (SWEDD) to support their activities, does not seem to serve as a strong
basis for effecting social change. This type of change requires not only strong ownership from government (ICR,
p. 37: “the current government has not undertaken any major reforms to close gender gaps) but also
ownership at the grassroots level over a sustained period. Even policies that attempt to change birth rates often
do not bear fruit, or at minimum, the returns on these types of “investments” are low.

While there may be non-economic reasons to provide policy financing assistance to countries such as
Niger, expectations on what achievements are feasible should be checked against the ability of a
government to manage and use money inflows in a responsible manner. The ICR describes the
government’s limited absorptive capacity of funding, its challenges in managing budgets, poor governance,
weak institutions, and low capacity (ICR, p. 6). Nonetheless, the DPF disbursed US$600 million within a short
period of time. Perhaps not surprisingly, the ICR documented “weakness of the inter-governmental coordination
mechanism in the preparation and implementation of the program” and noted that the relevant government
committee charged with DPO reform implementation “did not regularly monitor reform progress or collect the
necessary data for measuring achievement of the results" (ICR, p. 39).
