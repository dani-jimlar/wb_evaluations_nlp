2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The second Economic Management Support Operation (EMSO2) for Mongolia aimed to support the government
in “restoring debt sustainability, strengthening the social protection system, and enhancing competitiveness”
(Program Document 2 [PD2], p. 3). Compared to the first Economic Management Support Operation (EMSO1) in
the series, the program development objectives were slightly modified, in that the first objective read “fiscal
sustainability through fiscal adjustment” instead of “debt sustainability," and the third objective read “promoting”
instead of “enhancing” competitiveness (Program Document1 [PD1], p. 5). The original Development Policy
Operation (DPO) consisted of a three-part programmatic DPF series, but the third operation never materialized.

For the purpose of this ICRR, the objectives of the series (against which outcomes will be assessed) are taken to
be the following:

Objective 1: Restore debt sustainability.

Objective 2: Strengthen the social protection system.

Objective 3: Enhance competitiveness.

      Economic Management Support Operation (P162402)



The Series was structured around three pillars identical to the series objectives, namely i) restore debt
sustainability; ii) strengthen the social protection system, and iii) enhance competitiveness (PD, p. 17).


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The First Economic Management Support Operation First PDF (EMSO1) consisted of an IDA grant at a cost of
US$120 million (P162402). The Second Economic Management Support Operation (EMSO2), worth US$100
million, consisted of a US$20 million IBRD loan and a US$80 million IDA grant (P167485).

EMSO1 was approved on 30 November 2017 and closed as envisaged on 31 July 2018. EMSO2 was delayed
by a year, pushing the envisaged end of the DPF series to the end of FY20. There was also a change in scale
of financing, since the envisaged third DPF operation was eventually dropped. According to Bank staff, this
occurred “as progress in certain key structural reform areas stalled and the onset of COVID-19 in FY20
changed priorities for both the Government of Mongolia (GoM) and the Bank” (ICR, p. 5).


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 The objectives of the series were relevant to the country situation, the government’s reform program, and the
 Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) priorities for
 Mongolia.

 Relevance to country context

 Mongolia has made remarkable progress since its 1990s transition to a market-based economic system and
 democratic politics. The discovery of large mineral deposits and sizable investments in the sector have
 doubled gross domestic product (GDP) over the past decade, and the mining industry has acquired a
 dominant position in the country’s exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) volumes. On the other hand,
 overt reliance on an industry that only employs four percent of the country’s workforce poses
 considerable challenges to what used to be an economy reliant on livestock herding. These challenges
 are the “Dutch disease” of overt exposure to commodity prices volatility, inflation, and an appreciating
 currency, as well as the “natural curse disease” of bad governance practices, corruption, and social inequality
 (CPS 2013, p. 1). Since the early 2000s, GDP levels have quadrupled as a result of large-scale investment in
 the minerals sector as well as the shift away from reliance on livestock herding. Managing mining revenues to
 avoid inflation and currency pressures as well as over-borrowing and over-spending is crucial to maintaining
 macroeconomic stability.

 The need to restore fiscal sustainability through fiscal adjustment constitutes part of the wider attempt to
 modernize and diversify the Mongolian economy. Between 2011 and 2013, Mongolia grew on average by 14
 percent per annum, mainly due to high prices for minerals and large FDI inflows. During this period of double-
 digit growth, high inflation pressures persisted, and the current account deficit widened. After 2014, external
 shocks triggered by a sharp drop in commodity prices and slow growth in neighboring China were met by
 external borrowing and high spending. By 2016, the country’s vulnerabilities had reached unsustainable
 levels, with public debt levels quadrupling compared to 2011, the budget deficit reaching 17 percent of GDP,

and the Mongolian Togrog depreciating sharply as balance of payments pressures mounted. The
consolidated budget deficit of Mongolia, which includes the formal budget definition as well as off-budget
spending, reached 9 percent of GDP on average between 2012-2015 (PD, p. 8), and off-budget spending
averaged 5.4 percent in 2013-16 (PD, p. 9). A series of measures adopted since 2012 have enhanced the
generosity of the pension system by “reducing the retirement age of herders by 5 years, calculating each year
of herders’ contributory service as 1.5 years instead of one year; and introducing a second service “buyback”
option for herders and the self-employed. Under the current pension scheme, the state subsidy to the
pension fund is projected to increase to around 6 percent of GDP by 2030 and almost 11 percent of GDP by
2050” (PD, pp. 29-30). The economic slowdown after 2014 has affected social cohesion, with poverty rates
above 29 percent in 2016, perceived inequality going up, and declines in household consumption and
available household income. The anti-poverty programs of the government, namely the Child Money Program
(CMP) and the Food Stamps Program (FSP), are the largest social welfare programs of Mongolia, and their
reform aimed at enhancing efficient spending while targeting the really needy.

Given the challenging fiscal environment at the time the Series was initiated, the Series was well aligned with
the two pillars of the Government’s Economic Recovery Program, namely economic adjustment to overcome
short-term challenges and structural reforms for the long-term diversification of the economy and enhanced
competitiveness (PD1, p. 16). The rationale and design of Pillar II was based on Mongolia’s Social Welfare
Program Review (2015) and the Multi-Sectoral TA project (2011-2017), while the third was premised on the
2015 Agricultural Productivity and Marketing Study (2015) and the 2015 Agricultural Public Expenditure
Report (PD1, p. 19).

Relevance to CPF and country development strategy

The series objectives largely reflected government priorities specified in the two strategic pillars and were
pertinent to the country’s situation, especially the macroeconomic crisis of the 2013-2016 period.

In 2016 elections returned a government with a landslide victory and a reform-oriented program centered on
fiscal stability and economic reform. The Economic Reform Program (ERP) adopted by the government in
November 2016 was premised on two strategic pillars. On the one hand, the government aimed at economic
policy adjustment through the restoration of fiscal sustainability and the maintenance of financial stability. The
second pillar aimed at structural reforms to allow for long-term growth, and entailed measures such as
economic diversification, regulatory and governance reforms, and improving the legal and regulatory
framework of the banking system (PD1, p. 16). Soon after the adoption of the ERP, the government reached
a staff-level agreement with the IMF on a three-year Extended Term Financing Facility (EFF).

The 2013 CPS identified important challenges faced by Mongolia in the context of a growing economy and
the attainment of middle-income status. It stressed in particular the need to upgrade the country’s fiscal
position and management capacity: “Mongolia still has to tackle … unpredictable budgets, little long term
planning [and] poor public investment management” (CPS, p. 10).

The WBG’s 2017 Systematic Country Diagnostic identified three main challenges, namely unstable economic
growth, population wellbeing at risk, and growing climate-related and environmental stress. To tackle such
structural challenges, the SCD recommended an approach premised on diversified development, which is
especially relevant for resource-rich countries (Gill 2014). This would entail prudent macroeconomic
management and translation of formal legislation into actual implementation by way of better governance;
better-quality social services to assist with the transition away from reliance on the mining industry; and



                                                                                                     Page 4 of 28

private sector development as the main growth driver, no longer restrained by the crowding out of private
finance and uncertainty surrounding the investment climate.

Relevance to WBG priorities

The 2013-2017 CPS identified three areas through which to support Mongolia’s National Development
Strategy. First, the WBG would assist country authorities in upgrading the country’s regulatory and
institutional capacity as well as the design and implementation of policies that enable a more accountable,
transparent, and effective system of public revenues and expenditures. Second, emphasis would be placed
on economic diversification through the upgrading of the country’s investment climate and the capacity of
rural areas to enhance their economic output. The diversification of the economy away from the mining
industry was a core ingredient of that strategy, as the WBG’s analytical work emphasized the need to allow
for the country’s long-term economic prospects to become less reliant on volatile commodity prices and
export and FDI volumes dependent on the mining industry. A third priority would be to assist the country in
enhancing service delivery and its efficiency through reduced risks for vulnerable households and the design
of a modern, pro-poor social protection system (CPS, p. i). The CPS was extended twice, to 2020, so as to
align with the government’s development priorities.


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The series was structured around three pillars identical to the series objectives: (i) restoring debt
sustainability; (ii) strengthening the social protection system; and (iii) promoting the competitiveness of the
economy.

The two operations had a total of 19 prior actions (9 PAs in EMSO1 and 10 PAs in EMSO2). The policy and
results matrix do not include subobjectives, yet nine subobjectives emerge based on the PAs undertaken in
the two operations (ICR, pp. 6-7).

A total of 26 individual actions/subactions.

DPO 1: 9 PAs with a total of 10 actions/subactions

DPO 2: 10 PAs with 16 actions/subactions

The PAs were adequately based on lessons learned from previous experience and on prior technical work.
The design drew on lessons from prior engagement of both the World Bank and the IMF, and especially the
signing of the Extended Term Financial Facility (ETFF) a year prior to the start of the series. The first Pillar on
restoring debt sustainability drew from the Just-In-Time Public Expenditure Report (2016) as well as the 2015
Public Financial Management Report. The ETFF was important in design given some joint conditionality with
the IMF.

    Economic Management Support Operation (P162402)



The program documents (PD1 and PD2) generally provided a clear rationale for the vast majority of PAs and
the expected results.

Objective 1: Restoring debt sustainability, PAs 1 – 10.

PA1 (terminating the government’s DBM’s financing to capital expenditure through non-commercial loans)
and PA2 (publicly disclosing the comprehensive external special review on DBM’s operations from 2012–
2017) directly contributed to the achievement of the debt sustainability objective by aiming at reduced off-
budget expenditures by the DBM. Non-commercial loans issued by the DBM had been a major source of off-
budget operations, which had driven both budget debt and deficit levels high. These loans had financed
approximately 75 percent to the widening of the fiscal deficit between 2013-15 (ICR, p. 17). Ceasing non-
commercial loans constituted a first in a series of actions aiming at improving DBM’s commercial operations
and therefore breaking the link between DBM financial activities and off-budget expenditures, which had
made Mongolia’s consolidated budget deficit levels exceedingly high. These PAs were part of a series of
reforms that, in 2015, included in the standard budget what used to be the off-budget investment of the
DBM’s non-commercial loans. Since then, the WBG had been urging country authorities to stop DBM’s non-
commercial loans to the budget and place all public investments under unified control and monitoring of the
fiscal authorities. The WBG had also provided technical assistance to country authorities with the preparation
and organization of a credible and objective external review to enable the DBM to operate as a profitable
bank freed from political influence (PD1, p. 21). PA1: Satisfactory. PA2: Moderately Satisfactory.

PA3 (the BoM discontinuing net financing to the Housing Mortgage Program (HMP)), PA4 (restructuring the
Housing Mortgage Program to support affordable housing in a more cost‐effective way with a time‐bound
plan for BoM to fully exit the Housing Mortgage Program), and PA5 (publicly disclosing the independent
special external review on BoM’s quasi‐fiscal operations, including the Housing Mortgage Program, Price
Stabilization Program (PSP), and financial support to companies) were relevant because the BoM had been
undermining fiscal discipline through operations such as the HMP and PSP, which constitute quasi-fiscal
lending programs. Ceasing net financing to the Housing Mortgage Program constituted parallel conditionality
with the IMF and an immediate, short-term goal, on the back of which a more long-term process of
strengthening BoM credibility could be initiated, in turn allowing for progress towards meeting the PDO. This
would be facilitated through, on the one hand, the BoM’s full withdrawal from the costly and market distorting
HMP, and secondly, by disclosing the totality of BoM quasi-fiscal operations to identify the sources of
counterparty credit risk allocation by the BoM and the rise in non-performing loans (PD 2, p. 19). Allowing the
Housing Mortgage program to run as a revolving fund using only principal repayments and interest inflows for
additional loans constituted part of the government’s fiscal adjustment strategy. All three PAs aimed at
ensuring that BoM would cease to be treated as an expedient source of credit, which had raised concerns
regarding central bank governance and the efficiency of the credit allocation mechanism in Mongolia, factors
which contribute to debt sustainability. PA3: Satisfactory. PA4: Satisfactory. PA5: Moderately Satisfactory.

PA6 (raise the PIT rates on high income groups and the excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, with a gradual
increase of the minimum income tax threshold) was relevant because it was geared towards strengthening
tax revenues and was derived from analytical work through the Just-in-Time (JIT) Public Expenditure Review
(PER) of 2016. The PER considered short-term options for immediate fiscal adjustment in the wake of the
macroeconomic crisis, and the fact that revenue collection had fallen “from 34 percent of GDP in 2011 to 23.7
percent of GDP in 2016” (PD1, p. 24). Mongolia had a flat income tax rate of 10 percent, one of the lowest in
the world, and PTI-generated revenues equaled a mere 2.1 percent of GDP, lower than the world average (5
percent), East Asia and Pacific (3.7 percent), and lower middle-income countries (2.7 percent). The total

    Economic Management Support Operation (P162402)



revenue contribution of these measures, the PIT and excise tax reform, was calculated at about 2 percent of
GDP by 2019, thereby strengthening the country’s fiscal position. PA6: Satisfactory.

PA7 (establish a framework to evaluate the tax expenditure system to reduce ineffective tax incentives and
exemptions, starting with the 2020 budget) would contribute to making progress towards debt sustainability
by helping reduce one of the main sources of tax base erosion in the country, which are the exemptions and
tax holidays that lead to revenue erosion and constitute approximately 15 percent of all revenues (PD 1, p.
25), while total tax expenditures stood at 3.2 percent of GDP in 2017 (IMF 2019: 7). The PA would allow for a
cost-benefit analysis that would point to the individual characteristics of particular exemptions and incentives,
allowing for net fiscal savings once related reforms were undertaken. The action would assist authorities in
setting up a framework of analyzing the relative benefits of tax systems, instead of going further down the
results chain. PA7: Moderately Satisfactory.

PA8 (terminate the Promissory Note Program) was relevant because the program had been used to back up
public investment levels that could not be financed by available revenues. These notes were not counted as
expenditure until paid, thus understating true annual public expenditures, undermining debt sustainability and
allowing for off-budget expenditure to continue. By use of such notes in 2016 alone, public investment
increased by 2.8 percent of GDP (ICR, p. 17), reaching a total of 9.6 percent in 2016, undermining the goal of
fiscal consolidation. The use of promissory notes formed part of the wider challenge of accounting for off-
budget expenditures. PA8: Satisfactory.

PA9 (adopt a regulation to enhance appraisal, prioritization, and selection of projects) was linked to the use of
investment projects and the exponential increase of the country’s public investment budget, which went from
6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 9.6 percent in 2016 (PD1, p. 26). One of the major constraints in achieving debt
sustainability had been the absence of a sophisticated Public Investment Management (PIM) system. The PA
was part of a new PIM for Mongolia, premised on a joint IMF-Bank Public Investment Management
Assessment Report. The Report foresaw the introduction of elements of evaluation and assessment to
improve the quality of investments at entry point, as well as the setup of specific provisions for the
rationalization of the project portfolio. The regulation was adopted through Ministerial Order No.295, which
included updated guidelines on the appraisal and selection of new investments as well as a new
rationalization methodology for ongoing projects (PD2, p. 21). The expectation was that this would then
reduce capital expenditure from 9.6 percent in 2016 to 6 percent in 2019 (PD1, p. 27). PA9: Satisfactory.

PA10 (improve the legal, governance, and monitoring framework of the Government Special Funds that
extend loans and grants) was undertaken with the aim of improving the use and operationalization of the
government’s 29 special funds, following concerns about the SMEs Development Fund in
particular. Government Special Funds make up about 30 percent of the general government budget, and
concerns about the governance regime that surrounds their operation have been long-standing. The
improvement of the country’s legal and regulatory framework would go some way in reducing cases of public
resources misuse, enhancing the transparency and accountability of public funds, and indirectly assisting the
process of fiscal adjustment. The phrasing of the PA allowed for a lot of interpretation and was not fully clear
in terms of measurable progress towards the end result. PA10: Moderately Satisfactory.

Objective 2: Strengthening the social protection system, PAs 11-13.

PA11 (maintain budget allocation for the poverty‐targeted Food Stamp Program, in the 2017 Supplementary
budget, excluding administrative costs, at least at the level of the 2017 original budget) was relevant to the
protection of the poor because the policy of maintaining budget levels for poverty-targeted social welfare


                                                                                                     Page 9 of 28

programs, including the Child Money Program and the Food Stamp Program, would work in tandem with
fiscal consolidation and shelter vulnerable groups from the effects of fiscal consolidation. Maintaining
coverage of the poor through PA11 was necessary in the country context, given that the Food Stamp
Program covered less than 5 percent of households and provided less than 5 percent of poverty incomes for
a family of five. EMSO2 included a provision for the expansion of the FSP budget as well as the formation of
a new cash transfer program in the context of inadequate social expenditure. PA11: Satisfactory.

PA12 (increase the total budget allocation for the Food Stamp Program and other poverty‐targeted programs
in 2019 compared to the 2016 level) formed part of a wider, macro-level strategy of the government to
provide more resources to the poor and to vulnerable households. Poverty rates had increased in the period
after 2016, and maintaining cash buffers for the most vulnerable was a priority in the context of a sizable
fiscal consolidation effort. At a cost of 0.1 percent of GDP, the FSP was a fiscally effective way of providing
assistance to the poor. Therefore, this PA made a major contribution to attaining the overall objective. The
third part of the series foresaw such an outcome through an improved poverty targeting methodology
undertaken by the Ministry of Labor and Social protection through World Bank technical assistance. PA12:
Satisfactory.

PA 13 (amend the Social Insurance Law and the Pensions and Benefits Paid from Social Insurance Funds
Law to gradually increase the pension insurance contribution rate and the retirement age) was directly linked
to strengthening the pension system by enhancing its fiscal sustainability. The cost of social insurance
reached 2 percent of GDP in 2016, but a series of changes tilted towards making the system more generous
would entail rising costs, leading to projected expenditure levels of up to 6 percent of GDP by 2030 and 11
percent by 2050. PA13 entailed amending the existing Law on Social Insurance and the Law on Pensions
and Benefits Paid from Social Insurance Funds to improve the long-term sustainability of the pension system.
This would occur through an increase in the pension insurance contribution rate from 14 percent to 19
percent, and the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 65 for women. PA13: Satisfactory.

Objective 3: Enhancing competitiveness, PAs 14-19.

PA14 (establish the Investor Protection Council (IPC), aimed at fostering the timely and systematic resolution
of investor grievances) was relevant to making the Mongolian economy more competitive, given that the lack
of adequate mechanisms to protect investors and resolve disputes in a transparent and swift manner had
undermined investor confidence in the country. The lack of resolution and grievances had been identified by
an IFC client survey as central to the problems faced by 81 percent of companies operating in the country
(PD1, p. 31). This, in turn, created an uneven playing field for firms operating in the country, stifling
competition, and undermining the competitiveness of the economy. PA7 would strengthen investor
confidence in the possibility of swift resolution of disputes, therefore easing investor fears and facilitating
higher levels of investment. It would count on the power accorded to it by law and the fact that it would report
directly to the Prime Minister, allowing for smooth inter-agency coordination. PA14: Moderately Satisfactory.

PA15 (submit a revised Permit Law to Parliament, listing all licenses and permits granted by public
administrations and reducing their number) was an important PA in the context of Mongolia’s low ranking in
the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators with respect to regulatory quality. Frequent changes to
the legislative framework and unequal information and access to licenses and permits were highlighted by the
Bank’s prior analytical work as important factors in undermining investor confidence. This PA would allow for
a credible reduction in the number of permits required for regulatory purposes, since it would be premised on
the principle of reduced red tape and enhanced business predictability PA15: Satisfactory.

 PA 16 (submit draft legislation on animal health and propose the adoption of an animal health legal
 framework consistent with international standards) and PA17 (approve a package of regulations, ordinances,
 or guidelines to operationalize the Livestock and Animal Health Law) was relevant in the context of economic
 diversification for the Mongolian economy, and in the context of the government’s 2016-2020 Action Plan on
 the enhancement of its export competitiveness. Prior analytical work by the WBG had shown that the country
 retained high potential for red meat export, which would allow for a significant source of revenue other than
 minerals and the subsequent diversification of the country’s export portfolio. Middle-income countries have
 been shown to benefit from rising red meat demand in markets such as China’s, and Mongolia is well placed
 to benefit from rising demand. A new animal health law was necessary to reassure the international
 community regarding the safety of Mongolian exports and tackle the prevalence of diseases, such as foot and
 mouth and brucellosis (CPS 2013, p. 6), the outbreak of which had undermined Mongolia’s competitiveness
 in this sector. PA16: Satisfactory. PA17: Satisfactory.

 PA18 (ratify the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement [TFA]) and PA 19 (adopt the institutional framework for
 TFA implementation) was relevant in the context of Mongolia’s challenges pertaining to high trade costs, long
 delays, and a generally complex and opaque trade environment lowering trade competitiveness and the
 potential for export diversification. The combination of these challenges had meant that the country’s export
 potential had not been fully utilized, resulting in a business environment that was not attractive to established
 and emerging firms. Ratification of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, and subsequent implementation
 through the adoption of a concrete plan for timely implementation, would suggest to the international
 business community that Mongolia is bound by a set of globally agreed rules on the movement, release, and
 clearance of goods, and is willing to implement those. Adopting the institutional framework for
 implementing the TFA would be a giant step in the context of Mongolia. The TFA is a key institutional
 agreement of global dimensions enhanced by the fact that it entails a detailed set of liberalization guidelines
 and carries the normative weight of the WTO's stamp of approval. Spillover effects in terms of enhancing the
 business climate are therefore straightforward. Such action was necessary in a context in which Mongolia
 was ranked 108th out of 160 countries in the World Bank’s 2016 Logistics Performance Indicators and 100th
 in the important areas of customs and border management. PA18: Satisfactory PA19: Satisfactory.

4. Relevance of Results Indicators

Rationale

The results indicators (RIs) were generally placed within well-articulated results chains that measured the likely
impact of the PAs and their links to the stated objectives. Five of the 19 RIs were introduced in EMSO2 and
focused on strengthening the transparency and accountability framework of the banking and financial system, as
well as a more cost-efficient selection and implementation of public investment projects.

Some changes were introduced during the series, with many target dates shifting to account for the slightly
delayed launch of EMSO2 in 2020. RI8 on removing capital expenditure for the clearance of promissory notes
moved from 2019 in PD1 to 2020 in PD2. RI1’s base (capital expenditure financed by the DBM through non-
commercial loans) was revised in EMSO2 from MNT 240 billion to MNT 252 billion, while the EMSO1 RI on

                                                                                                     Page 11 of 28

aggregate tax revenues from PIT and excise tax on alcohol and tobacco was dropped ahead of EMSO2, as the
government opted to restore the flat income tax structure in 2018. RI6 on reducing tax exemptions and
incentives was articulated in MNT targets in EMSO1. Following the 2018 Public Expenditure Review and the
2019 adoption by Parliament of a set of tax amendment laws that introduced international tax and accounting
standards to domestic laws, this RI was expressed in percentage of total tax revenue in PD2.

Some changes led to upward revision. In Pillar 2 and regarding the strengthening of the social protection
system, RI13 was originally intended to double the number of five-member families benefitting from the Food
and Stamp program (FSP), but that was revised to tripling the FSP’s budget in EMSO2. This suggests that the
capabilities to implement may have been underestimated (or risks overestimated). The reverse was the case in
RI14 with reference to state subsidies for the pension system. The original target of 2 percent state subsidy by
2030 was changed to a “fiscally sustainable level” (PD2, p. 43), because of the GoM dropping earlier plans on
pension reform.

Twelve of the 19 RIs are rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory, and seven are rated
Unsatisfactory or Moderately Unsatisfactory

Relevance of RIs for Objective 1: Restore debt sustainability.

RI1 (capital expenditure financed by the Development Bank of Mongolia through non-commercial loans) directly
measured an important determinant of progress toward the objective of restoring debt sustainability by limiting
DBM financing. The baseline data and target were credible, with data readily available and used to monitor
progress. RI1’s base was slightly revised in EMSO2 from MNT 240 billion to MNT 252 billion. RI1: Satisfactory.

RI2 (ceasing net financing from the Bank of Mongolia to the Housing Mortgage Program) directly measured
progress towards the debt sustainability objective, given that BoM had engaged in large quasi-fiscal operations,
with the HMP and the PSP among them. The baseline data and target were credible, and the definition of net
financing specified in PD1 to entail new mortgages financing more than principal repayment inflows (PD1, p. 23).
The indicator captured the objective of debt sustainability through the rationalization of public expenditure, one
of the two elements of the implied theory of change leading to sustainability (the second one being enhanced
revenues). RI2: Satisfactory.

RI3 (improving the legal and regulatory framework of mortgage securitization) constituted part of the indicators
used to measure progress towards achieving higher levels of transparency for BoM operations. The target set
could not be concretely measured since it entailed the issuing of an action plan (to strengthen the existing
framework), the content of which was not specified. No data as to progress made or the ways to measure it has
been made available in the ICR. RI3: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

RI4 (withdrawing outstanding assets for the PSP and keeping the level of outstanding corporate holdings stable)
followed the same rationale as RI2 in focusing on the BoM quasi-fiscal operations as a major factor behind the
increased deficit of the 2013-2016 period. The indicator measured, directly and concretely with available data
and periodic monitoring of progress, the withdrawal of BoM loans to the PSP program, which was rightly
expected to have a direct impact on Mongolia’s consolidated budget deficit level. There was no detailed
information available as to which corporate holdings the indicator referred to. RI4: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI5 (advancing banks’ recapitalization to meet prudential norms) adequately captured the likely impact of
improved BoM transparency and corporate governance since it related to another task of bank recapitalization
and regulatory improvement in that sector. Benchmark and target data have been available and updated,

                                                                                                   Page 16 of 28

reflecting long-standing cooperation on this matter between the WB, the IMF, and the government. RI5:
Satisfactory.

RI6 (reducing tax exemptions and incentives) addressed revenue mobilization and articulated a credible way of
measuring progress towards enhancing revenues. The focus on reducing tax exemptions was premised on the
World Bank’s 2018 PER, which had identified exemptions and incentives as a major source of tax erosion (PD2,
p. 20). The indicator was articulated in MNT targets in PD1 but in percentage of total tax revenue in PD2. (ICR,
p. 18). RI6: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI7 (introduce a General Anti-Avoidance Rule) constituted a trigger in DPL2 in the framework of aligning
Mongolia’s tax regime with international regulatory standards and enhancing revenue mobilization by reducing
tax avoidance. Previous research and analytical work pointed to the fact that although Mongolia had large
revenue foregone as a result of tax evasion, it lacked a cost-benefit system of evaluating individual tax policies
(PD2, p. 20). RI7: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI8 (removing capital expenditure for the clearance of promissory notes) captured fully the impact of terminating
the Promissory Note Program, which had been directly linked to the massive increase in public investment
expenditure in 2016. Data was readily available and measurement straightforward. Target dates on this
indicator shifted (from 2019 to 2020) due to the delayed launch of EMSO2. RI8: Satisfactory.

RI9 (improving the efficiency of public investment portfolio) captured the likely impact of a new government
regulation pertaining to the selection and implementation of public investment projects. Ministerial Order 295
included elements of both appraisal and selection of new investments, as well as a new methodology to
rationalize ongoing projects. However, the indicator did not adequately allow for measuring progress toward the
achievement of debt sustainability, since an improved public investment portfolio could lead to a reprioritization
of existing projects due to factors others than cost only, thus not providing a clear way to measure whether debt
sustainability can be achieved. RI9: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

RI10 (improved selection of new public investment projects) directly captured the impact of Ministerial Order 295
and also built on pre-existing data on the need to rationalize the selection of investment projects, as well as the
joint Bank-Fund Public Investment Management Assessment Report. RI10: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI11 (disclosing Government Special Funds beneficiaries) directly captured the impact of an improved
governance framework for the 29 active special funds through Resolution 87 of 2019 (PD2, p. 22), which ceased
operations for seven funds, improved the function of three, merged another three, and allowed for the continued
operation of the remaining funds. Data sources pertaining to its calculation were not offered. RI11: Moderately
Satisfactory.

R12 (Government Special Funds extended through banks with good standing) captured the likely impact of
Resolution 87 on special funds’ operation, and allowed for measurement of progress toward debt sustainability
through improved functioning of the banking sector premised on the 2017 Asset Quality Review. Data on
baseline and target as well as sources were vague, considering that neither PD2 nor the ICR specified the
banks involved or their capitalization. RI12: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for Objective 2: Strengthen the social protection system.

RI13 (coverage and benefit size of the Food Stamp Program and other poverty-targeted programs) captured the
likely impact of maintaining and subsequently expanding the budget size of the FSP. RI13 was originally


                                                                                                     Page 17 of 28

intending to double the number of five-member families benefitting from the FSP, but that was revised to tripling
the FSP’s budget in EMSO2. RI13: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI14 (pension reform options simulation toolkit (PROST) model projections of the state subsidy to the
pension fund used as basis for estimating baseline and projection with reforms) captured the likely impact of
legal amendments to the pension system legislation of 2017, premised on concrete calculations of the expected
direct state subsidy to the pension fund. The original target of 2 percent state subsidy by 2030 was changed to
an ill-defined “fiscally sustainable level” (PD2, p. 43) because the GoM dropped earlier plans on pension reform.
RI14: Moderately Satisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for Objective 3: Enhance competitiveness.

RI15 (number of permits and licenses) directly captured the likely impact of the PA of a “revised Permit Law
listing all licenses and permits needed for the operation of businesses and aiming at a reduction of the same
over time” (ICR, p. 20). The PA pointed to a more transparent system that would ease business functioning in
the country, the necessity of which was adequately explained in PD1 and PD2. Baseline and target data
were adequately monitored. RI15: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI16 (share of investor grievances successfully treated by the IPC to the total number of investor grievances
received by the IPC) directly captured the likely impact of setting up an Investor Protection Council. The
definition of the indicator is vague, and there is no data as to the criteria used by the IPCV in reaching its
decisions or the mechanisms used to arrive at fair decisions. RI16: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

RI17 (number of outbreaks of, and small ruminants vaccinated against, PPR (Peste des Petits Ruminants) in
western region) directly captured the impact of PA16 and PA17 on revising the country’s animal health law to
improve the competitiveness of livestock products through better health and regulatory standards. While neither
the PDs nor the ICR for this series explained the specific importance of PPR, the Project Appraisal Document for
a Bank-financed Livestock Commercialization Project in Mongolia (US$30 million, 2019-2025, P165945)
explained that PPR, among other infectious diseases (foot and mouth, brucellosis, anthrax) were not under
control and were impairing the ability of Mongolian producers to provide high-quality products for export (PAD, p.
11). Data sources and measurement were well articulated, although it was not fully clear whether the objective
centered on disease outbreak or virus elimination. RI17: Moderately Satisfactory.

RI18 (proportion of shipments selected for physical inspection) captured the likely impact of trade facilitation
reform for border management, which constituted part of the results chain that would lead to enhanced trade
competitiveness. The necessity of reducing physical inspections of cargos was explicitly mentioned in PD2 (p.
28) as part of the trade facilitation package, and the RI used measurable and traceable data to suggest how
progress towards reaching the objective could be measured. Target dates for results were shifted to end-2020.
RI18: Satisfactory.

RI19 (average customs clearance time) captured the likely impact of trade facilitation reforms, which constituted
part of a results chain that could lead to enhanced trade competitiveness through export diversification and
private sector expansion (PD1, p. 36). PD2 discussed a host of reforms pertaining to the formation of a Trade
Facilitation Committee and related roadmap and strategic plan (PD2, p. 28). The indicator was clearly defined
and data measurable over time. The baseline was articulated in hours and minutes, but the target was
expressed in percentage of reduced clearance time. It would have been better to formulate a disaggregated set
of targets on road, rail, and air when measuring customs clearance efficiency. RI19: Moderately Satisfactory.

               Restore debt sustainability [PAs 1-10, RIs 1-12]

               Rationale
               RI1: The target of eliminating DBM capital expenditure towards non-commercial loans was fully met, and by
               2017 the DBM had undertaken necessary action to bring its loan portfolio from the state budget to zero (ICR,
               p. 21). The elimination of capital finance expenditure by the DBM during 2020 made an important contribution
               to the process of rationalizing public expenditure, which is in turn linked to the gradual reduction of public debt
               levels, from 87.6 percent in 2016 to 69.2 percent in 2019 (CPF2, p. 7). Although this specific target
               was achieved, concerns about DBM governance and its balance sheet continue, as echoed by a 2022 IMF
               Statement on the subject. Rating: High.

               RI2: Net financing from the BoM to the Housing Mortgage Program was partially achieved, despite the strong
               initial progress made. Although net financing was below zero during the FY18-20 period resulting from
               outward financing having fallen below the levels of incoming coupon payments and principal flows, things
               changed afterwards. “Loan repayment deferrals were approved as part of a package of COVID-19 relief
               measures in 2020, with the result that net financing rose above zero in FY21” (ICR, p. 21). The Housing
               Mortgage Program has yet to be transferred to the government from the BoM. Rating: Modest.

               RI3: Steps towards revamping the legal and regulatory framework on mortgage securitization appear to have
               been taken, but there is a lack of credible data on the subject, both in the ICR and PD. A working group was
               established in 2019 as per the ICR and as foreseen in PD2, but its work has not yet been completed. Rating:
               Modest.

               RI4: BoM’s outstanding assets for the PSP were reduced in line with the target, and all loans to the PSP were
               fully withdrawn. Progress was made with the reduction of outstanding corporate bond holdings as well, since
               the original target of no more than MNT 815 billion was exceeded. Rating: High.

               RI5: The intended Asset Quality Review (AQR) to facilitate bank recapitalization took place as envisaged and
               allowed for capital shortfalls to be identified. The banks affected by the AQR were able to raise fresh capital,
               and following a forensic review two (out of the five) systemically important banks were judged to be compliant
               with the required CARs in 2020 (ICR, p. 21), which constitutes impact resulting from the PA on an
               independent external special review and shortfalls’ identification. Given that two out of five banks have been
               capitalized, the rating given is Modest. An additional factor affecting the rating is that not all banks have been
               subject to the same discipline, and some small banks remain potentially in trouble. This became evident

during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the quality of some banks' balance sheets was negatively affected,
leading to a decision for a new AQR in 2022. Rating: Modest.

RI6: The initial target of reducing tax exemptions by 1.5 points was exceeded by more than twice, as the
reduction of 3.8 percentage points greatly promoted the objective of debt sustainability. The ambitious
original targets of setting excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol, as well as raising personal income tax levels in
line with most other countries, were abandoned in the final results matrix. Rating: High.

RI7: The General Anti-Avoidance Rule has been included in the country’s tax legislation since 2020 and
formed part of the 2018 PER recommendations on aligning Mongolia’s tax rules better with international
standards. It constituted progress towards meeting the objectives of PA7 on a more transparent framework,
as international tax accounting standards have been introduced by law since 2018 and 2019 (ICR, p. 22).
Rating: Substantial.

RI8: Capital expenditure for the clearance of promissory notes is no longer practiced, which removed a major
source of off-budget expenditure. More details as to the data, its source, and tracking is elusive, as the ICR
only mentions the indicator in passing, leading to a downgrade. Rating: Substantial.

RI9: The ICR mentions “process improvement” in the selection of the public investment portfolio. The
adoption of Ministerial Order 295 in 2018 entailed a new regulation for appraisal, selection, and prioritization
of new investment projects. The implementation of the Public Investment Rationalization Guidelines allowed
for the objective restructuring of ongoing investment projects in line with the new criteria, but the indicator
was only able to capture efficiency partly, since it did not define improvement in terms of a measurable cost
aspect. Rating: Modest.

RI10: The selection of new public investment projects improved as a result of the adoption of the Guidelines
and the adoption of the Ministerial Order pertaining to public investment. The indicator was specific enough to
capture progress made towards sustainability by offering a target on project selection. Available data on
public investment project numbers and the implementation of the new criteria since 2018 suggests that the
target of having most new projects subject to the Guidelines has not been reached, leading to a downgrade.
Rating: Substantial.

RI11: Government special funds have been disclosed in line with the RI target and following on from PA6 on
transparency. The government’s legal framework was amended accordingly, through Resolution 89. This
allowed for progress to be made in capturing the benefits of enhanced transparency of the issue of such
funds regarding fiscal stability. The latest available data points to the fact that for some funds, such disclosure
has not been possible, and issues pertaining to the small enterprises fund in particular continue to linger.
Rating: Substantial.

RI12: Government special funds are now exclusively disbursed through banks who are in good standing,
following the Asset Quality Review. This corresponds to PA10 on the use of special funds and their
disbursement, and allows for important progress in eliminating off-budget expenditures that had contributed to
unsustainable levels prior to 2017. Rating: Substantial.

Satisfactory



OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Strengthen the social protection system [PAs 11-13, RIs 13-14]

Rationale
RI13: Although PD1 made explicit reference to the Child Money Program and its reform, PD2 made only
vague reference to other poverty-related programs, apart from the FSP. The result indicator on the Food
Stamp program was achieved and the overall budget size devoted to the program was tripled by 2020
compared to four years earlier. This allowed for concrete progress to be made in achieving the objective by
assisting the most vulnerable at a time of fiscal consolidation. A wider attempt to “rationalize social welfare”
(PD2, p. 23) through poverty targeting was dropped, as the onset of the pandemic led to a reprioritization of
budget item expenditures. Rating: High.

RI14: The indicator has been off track since 2017, when amendments to the then-existing pension legislation
widened eligibility for pension fund subsidies for herders and retired mothers, while also guaranteeing social
insurance premiums paid by the state to mothers looking after children below the age of three (PD2, p. 24).
The three-phased program of pension reform, which would have been extended to the third (dropped)
operation in this series, has not materialized. Rating: Negligible.



Rating
Moderately Satisfactory



OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
Enhance competitiveness [PAs 14-19, RIs 15-19]

Rationale
RI15: The number of permits and licenses was reduced by more than the targeted 10 percent. Exceeding the
target has allowed for important progress to be made in the dimension of enhanced competitiveness relating
to investor confidence. Rating: High.

RI16: The setup of the Investor Protection Council (IPC) has allowed for a friendlier business environment,
taking into account the high number of business complaints registered before. The target was met and
exceeded by some, as no new complaints were registered in 2020 or 2021. Rating: High.

RI17: The indicator contained two targets and was subjective in nature and interpretation. Although no new
outbreaks of the PPR disease were reported in the western region as specified by the RI, the ICR mentions
Bank staff reporting the presence of virus in unvaccinated animals. One result indicator, relating to the

                  cumulative number of vaccinations for small ruminants, dropped from 25 million to 20 million. The cumulative
                  number of vaccinations was about 40 percent of the target by 2020, when the outbreak of the COVID-19
                  pandemic occurred. Combined with inability to verify data, this leads to a Modest rating. Rating: Modest.

                  RI18: The ICR was not able to verify whether the target on the number of shipments selected for physical
                  inspection was met or not. Rating: Negligible.

                  RI19: Data on the reduction of average customs clearance time has not been verified, and it is unknown
                  whether the target was met. The ICR includes a table that demonstrates a deterioration in the time it takes to
                  both import and export, as well as in the efficiency of customs clearance. Rating: Negligible.

6. Outcome

Rationale

The Satisfactory rating for relevance of PAs was based on their sound design to build on initiatives and lessons
from previous analytical work and country engagement and, in most cases, to carry the agenda forward in
successive, manageable steps. The rationale for each action was generally well articulated (though the chain of
further actions and results to achieve objectives was not as well clarified).

The Moderately Satisfactory rating for efficacy resulted from 11 out of 19 targets being achieved or partially
achieved. Although the introduction of excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, as well as the PIT reform under
PDO 1, were eventually dropped, off-budget expenditure reforms pertaining to the functioning of the BoM and
DBM contributed to the key objective of restoring debt sustainability in line with expected outcomes. The debt-
to-GDP ratio declined by 9 percentage points between 2017 and 2019, thus fulfilling the first objective of the

Series. The envisaged spillover effect (stronger public finances allowing for more generous social protection
expenditure) did occur, but the abandonment of the more ambitious long-term reform of the pension system
derailed the relevant RI. The setup of an Investor Protection Council and progress on reducing red tape allowed
for enhanced competitiveness to a certain extent, yet the result indicators on customs and clearance, as well as
the lack of clarity on animal disease spread, moderated progress. With relevance of PAs rated as Satisfactory
and efficacy as Moderately Satisfactory, the overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory.


a. Rating

Moderately Satisfactory

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Pandemic Risk: The onset of the pandemic aggravated pre-existing political risks (see below) regarding the
sustainability of public finances in general and the stabilization of debt levels to a lower median in particular.
After COVID-19 disrupted economic life, progress achieved as part of the Series on eliminating off-budget
expenditure through action on the DBM and BoM were partially reversed. As a result of the pandemic, a round of
forbearance for banks affected the quality of some of these banks’ balance sheets, as evidence by the IMF's
Article IV consultation in 2021, while concerns were also raised regarding the operational autonomy of the BoM.
“Expansive fiscal and quasi-fiscal measures" (ICR, p. 22) were adopted by the government, leading to a
deterioration of the country’s fiscal position by 2022, thereby potentially undermining progress made in fiscal
consolidation in the medium term (ICR, Table 2, p. 22). Instead of the envisaged targeted support to vulnerable
individuals and households foreseen in Pillar 2 of the Series, COVID-19 led to a broad-based social assistance
strategy, which could translate in enhanced vulnerability of poor households post-pandemic relative to the
overall population.

Political Risk: Early in the Series, elections led to a change in government. Under pressure from Parliament, the
government adopted fiscal measures that derailed progress toward some of the program’s targets, especially
with reference to strengthening social protection (the envisaged pension reform) as well as the implementation
of some targets pertaining to a more cost-efficient system of public investments. “Such risks continue to apply to
key program achievements, namely, the disengagement of the DBM from making capital loans to the GoM, the
winding down of corporate bond purchases by the BoM, the elimination of promissory notes as a means of
funding capital expenditure by the GoM, and the reduction of tax exemptions. Mongolia’s relatively volatile
political system with frequent changes in Parliament and government implies risks of reversals in some of the
policy changes supported by the series” (ICR, p. 31).

The abandonment of plans regarding the introduction of excise taxes and the raising of personal income tax
rates wipes out potential budget revenue streams and potentially raises the risk of a return to boom-and-bust
cycles that will necessitate fresh rounds of fiscal consolidation. The approval of a draft pension Law by Cabinet
in 2021 and the hiking of the minimum wage in 2022 (ICR, p. 23) add to the fiscal risks by undermining earlier
fiscal consolidation efforts, while the budget subsidy to the budget fund is projected to reach six percent of GDP
by 2030, risking the sustainability of the pension system. More generally, the persistence of high subsidies for
middle and high-income earners, combined with low taxation levels, make Mongolia vulnerable to
macroeconomic shocks beyond the series and in combination with commodity price volatility.

8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Analytical underpinnings: The rationale for each policy action was well documented based on prior analytical
work, by the World Bank and the IMF, including staff analysis (ICR, Table 4). For PD1, the operation was
supported by the IMF’s 2015 Article IV Consultation Report, the 2015 World Bank Mongolia Economic Update,
the 2015 WB Review of Social Welfare Programs, the 2015 Agriculture Productivity and Marketing Study of the
World Bank, and its Just in Time Public Expenditure Review. For PD2, the operation relied on the SFSS WB
project, a TA on the Financial Sector, the 2018 IMF PIMA Report, and the 2018 Investment Reform Map.
Through extensive analytical work across the three policy areas, the WB has been able to develop an integrated
approach to assistance to Mongolia.

Results chain: The ICR presented a “theory of change” for each pillar, describing how most (although not all)
PAs were expected to contribute to program objectives. The theory of change was a bit short and could have
been better explained in the program documents. PD1 and PD2 both entailed a detailed explanation of most
PAs and their respective rationale. The relationship between PAs and the intended outcomes was generally
evident.

Risk identification and mitigation: “Both DPF operations were considered vulnerable to political, macroeconomic
and institutional performance risks and were identified as such in the PD. Political risks, in particular, affected
the implementation of both operations, and ultimately contributed to the cancellation of an envisaged third
operation” (ICR, p. 29). Political risk mitigation was attempted through the disengagement of the DBM and BoM
from fiscal roles and off-budget expenditures in the first operation, following the election of a reformist
government in 2017. In the second operation, risk mitigation strategies relied on a new set of objectives
pertaining to transparency and accountability in the issue of Government Special Funds. Risks associated with
loose fiscal policy ahead of the 2020 election were flagged by PD2. Economic risks related to the cyclical nature
of commodity prices, on which Mongolia has long relied (ICR, p. 28), as well as border bottlenecks with China.
Mitigation focused on attempted economic diversification through various measures under Pillar 3 as well as
fiscal consolidation, which constituted the bulk of both operations.

Stakeholder consultation: For PD1, a “Partnership for Sustainable Development” consultation meeting took
place, attended by the prime minister, cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, and development partners. “The
government has been also carrying out extensive public outreach activities, through numerous participations in
media panel discussions, roundtables with academia and business associations, and consultation meetings with
labor union and civil society organizations” (PD1, p. 37). For PD2, the World Bank held
a series of “consultation meetings and public presentations with relevant standing committees of parliament
and local government as well as well as academics and the business community” (PD2, p. 29). The Bank
“leveraged the SCD and CPF consultations in August-September 2017 and January 2019 to discuss reform
priorities with a broad range of stakeholders in Mongolia” (ICR, p. 31).

Coordination with development partners: The Bank coordinated well with developments partners during the
Series, such as with the ADB during the Series preparation stage in terms of needs identification. There has
been coordination with the IMF regarding the macroeconomic framework and policy recommendations as

                                                                                                    Page 24 of 28

evidenced through the Bank’s Mongolia Economic Updates and the Fund’s Article IV Missions and subsequent
recommendations, especially on banking sector reform. The Bank also coordinated with Japan, and the ADB.



Rating

Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Monitoring and coordination with partners: The Bank leveraged the upcoming SCD for consultations with
stakeholders in Mongolia, and liaised with Parliament committees, academics, and the business world during the
DPF series preparation. A supervision and pre-identification mission was conducted in June 2018, and a follow-
up (preparation) mission in October 2018. The missions concluded that steady progress on the fiscal front had
taken place and that progress was visible on PAs and triggers for the second and third operations.
“Assessments of the macro‐economic framework and policy recommendations were exchanged between the
World Bank and the IMF, through the World Bank’s regular Mongolia Economic Updates and the IMF’s Article IV
missions and sequential reviews of its EFF program” (ICR, p. 31).

Adaptation: The change in Mongolia’s political conditions in 2017 meant that parts of the Series’ objectives were
undermined, especially with reference to pension and tax reforms. In consultation with the IMF and the ADB, the
World Bank decided to proceed with a redesigned EMSO2. The new focus was less on fiscal conditions and
more on meeting structural reforms, such as the elimination of off-budget capital expenditure and the expansion
of social welfare. When in 2020 it became clear that elements of EMSo2, such as bank recapitalization, had not
proceeded as planned, the Bank decided not to launch EMSO3. Instead, bilateral assistance to Mongolia shifted
in line with the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR includes a detailed breakdown of the calculated effects of the series on poverty levels, and the results
of a related Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. The PSIA suggested neutral to positive effects on poverty as a
result of the potential introduction of excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco as well as higher PIT levels. A 2020
World Bank study aiming at understanding the large gender life expectancy gap in Mongolia (men: 66.4 years,
women 76 years) revealed a significant correlation between male adherence to stereotypical masculine norms
and engagement in risky behavior. 60 percent of men were smokers, and 71 percent had consumed alcohol
during the previous year. Tobacco and alcohol use were identified as primary reasons behind the life
expectancy gap, since they result in premature death and adverse health outcomes (World Bank 2020, p.
8). Enhanced budgetary allocations to the Food Stamp program, combined with higher growth and an increase
in commodity prices after 2018, led to a reduction in poverty from 29.6 percent to 27.8 percent in 2020 according
to the 2020 Household Socio-Economic Survey (ICR, p. 25). Most of the decline affected rural areas, with
poverty there dropping from 34.9 percent in 2016 to 26.5 percent in 2020. However, the sustainability of lower
poverty levels is doubtful going forward if one considers that in urban areas, where the majority of the population
resides, poverty went down by a very thing margin: from 27 percent in 2016 to 26.5 percent in 2020. The PSIA
simulation entailed potentially pro-poor effects because of economic diversification and a better investment
climate (Pillar 3), although concrete data were not mentioned in the ICR.

The ICR provides a compact summary of the context at appraisal and rationale for the series, explains the
evolution of the PDOs, and gives a coherent narrative of the series and the results. It discusses most, although
not all, of the prior actions and their relevance to a “theory of change” (results chain). Some of the evidence
presented in the ICR could have been of higher quality with relevance to some Pillar I PAs in particular. The
results chain is divided into each of the three pillars of the DPFs and is a bit short. The efficacy section
(Achievement of Objectives) is extensive and in line with ICR Guidelines, but not all results indicators are
adequately discussed. The sections on other outcomes, Bank performance, risks and lessons are in line with
ICR Guidelines, and the lessons section is fairly extensive (although a bit general).

12. Lessons

The ICR rightly underlined the need to take political feasibility variables, and the potential for political instability,
more into account at the design stage, This can help improve future operations and their policy programs
design. To illustrate, the influence of political considerations became evident soon after the first operation was
launched, as tax and pension reform measures were either stopped or reversed (ICR, p. 33). This is especially
important given the country context and prior experience with policy reversals. When it comes to a closely
associated lesson pertaining to political volatility concerns, this could manifest itself in two ways: first, shortening
the duration of the operations with a more manageable timeframe, and second, by making sure that structural
reforms are frontloaded to a greater extent, so that potential changes in political conditions do not affect
structural commitments. Structural reform interventions pertaining to the use of government special funds and
BoM transparency were evident in the series, but became central to operations only after tax and other goals
were abandoned.

Result indicators can be more precise and tangible result indicators can assist the process of more effective
outcomes measurement. This was evident regarding animal health vaccinations, where it was not fully clear
whether the objective centered on disease outbreak or virus elimination. It would have been much better to
formulate a disaggregated set of targets on road, rail, and air when measuring customs clearance efficiency.

The ICR mentions slow cultural change as a lesson derived from the Series with reference to the slow pace of
improvement in custom processing times. However, the fact that tangible progress was made in some sectors,

                                                                                                         Page 27 of 28

such as in permits and licenses, suggests that future improvement is less related to cultural attributes and more
to human resources management.
