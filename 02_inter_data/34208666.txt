a. Objectives

According to Program Document (PD), the program development objectives (PDOs) of the Togo Emergency
COVID-19 Emergency Development Policy Operation (the operation) were to: (a) strengthen the crisis
response framework for better health outcomes, (b) mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the
crisis, and (c) lay the foundations for economic recovery.

This ICR Review parses the program objectives as:

1. PDO 1: To strengthen the crisis response framework for better health outcomes;
2. PDO 2: To mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis;
3. PDO 3: To lay the foundations for economic recovery – in food and agriculture, by guaranteeing access to
agricultural inputs; and
4. PDO 4: To lay the foundations for economic recovery – in public finance, by digitalizing tax payments by
enterprises.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The operation had three pillars, aligned with the strategy adopted by the Bank in response to COVID-19
(World Bank, 2020, Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact, and Getting Back on Track).

Pillar 1: Protecting Lives supported measures to help Togo meet its health emergency needs following
World Health Organization (WHO) guidance and protocols: (a) the creation of a national body to coordinate
the national response to the pandemic; (b) the institution of a health surveillance and contact tracing system;
(c) the activation of a laboratory diagnostics and case management system; and (d) the designation of
isolation centers and facilities in each region.

Pillar 2: Protecting Livelihoods supported temporary emergency measures to protect the poor and
vulnerable, for at least three months during the crisis: (a) a new cash transfer program for displaced informal
workers and poor housekeepers in urban areas; (b) the extension of a cash transfer project for poor
households in rural areas; and (c) waivers of electricity and water charges for poor households served by the
Electricity Power Company of Togo and the Togolese Water Company.

Pillar 3: Protecting the Future supported four measures in two sectors to help lay the foundations for an
economic recovery from the crisis: (a) in food and agriculture – the expansion of the YOLIM program of free-
interest loans for agricultural inputs and the creation of a digital platform to convey inputs and advisory
services to farmers; and (b) in public finance – the digitalization of tax payment services for enterprises to help
with tax administration and revenue mobilization and the production and publication of reports on public debt
and fiscal risk to improve public debt transparency and management.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

Program Cost and Financing. The operation was estimated to cost SDR 56.8 million (US$70 million) at
appraisal. The operation was financed by an International Development Association (IDA) credit of SDR 31.1
million (US$35 equivalent million) and an IDA grant of SDR 25.5 million (US$35 million equivalent), both of which
were fully disbursed. The difference in the US$ equivalent amounts at appraisal and at closing was due to
changes in SDR:US$ exchange rate.

Dates. The operation was approved on September 10, 2020 (six months after WHO declared COVID-19 a
global pandemic), became effective on October 9, 2020, and closed as scheduled on September 30, 2021.

3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Country COVID-19 Crisis Response Strategy. The objectives aimed to address the health, economic, and
 social impacts posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

       Threats to Public Health. Togo was highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 outbreak because: (a) it was a
        regional transportation hub; (b) it had strong commercial ties to badly affected countries and regions,
        including China and the European Union; and (c) the health care system was poorly prepared for the
        health crisis (Togo Ministry of Finance, April 2020, Letter of Intent to the IMF – Request for Support
        under the Catastrophe Containment Window of the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust).
       Threats to the Economy. The COVID-19 outbreak was hindering economic activity. On the supply
        side, commercial activities related to the major ports (Lome and Kpeme) and airport (Lome-Tokoin)
        were severely affected. On the demand side, the containment measures and the uncertain business
        environment stalled consumption and investment. Economic growth was projected to decelerate to 3
        percent in 2020, reversing a 5.5 percent growth forecast before COVID-19. The budgetary implications
        of lower revenue collection and higher healthcare costs (the Government planned to increase health
        sector outlays by about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2020) was estimated at about 1.7 percent of GDP. The
        balance of payments financing need was estimated at about US$130 million (2 percent of GDP) (Togo
        Ministry of Finance, April 2020, Letter of Intent to the IMF – Request for Support under the Catastrophe
        Containment Window of the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust).
       COVID-19 Response Plan. Togo adopted the COVID-19 National Preparedness and Response
        Plan in April 2020, shortly after the WHO declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in
        March 2020. The Plan – which aimed to upgrade the health system, contain the economic fallout of
        the crisis, and provide targeted support to the vulnerable – had three pillars: (a) limiting the contagion
        of COVID-19 and caring for the sick; (b) preventing a poverty increase; and (c) preparing for the
        recovery, with measures to support the private sector, protect jobs, and stimulate agriculture. The
        DPO objectives were relevant to the health and economic threats that the country faced and were
        consistent with the three pillars of the Plan.

 Bank Group COVID-19 Crisis Response Strategy. The program objectives were aligned with the strategy
 articulated in the World Bank Group COVID-19 Crisis Response Approach Paper – Saving Lives, Scaling-up
 Impact and Getting Back on Track (2020). The strategy paper promoted four pillars: (a) saving lives – prevent,
 detect, and respond to the health threat posed by COVID-19 and strengthen national systems for public health
 preparedness; (b) protecting the poor and vulnerable – protect poor and vulnerable households and
 communities from the economic and social shocks of the crisis, restore human capital, and promote equity and
 inclusion in the recovery; (c) supporting business growth and job creation – maintain the private sector so that
 viable firms do not exit as a result of the pandemic; and (d) strengthening policies, institutions, and
 investments for rebuilding better – maintain a line of sight to long-term goals during the relief and
 restructuring stages to regain momentum on the twin goals of economic growth and poverty reduction in
 recovery. The program objectives corresponded to the first, second, and fourth pillars of the Bank strategy.

 Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy. The program objectives were also aligned with the country
 strategy for Togo. The Country Partnership Framework for the Republic of Togo for the Period FY17-FY20
 (CPF) committed Bank Group support for the country's development priorities organized around three focus
 areas – private sector performance and job creation, inclusive public service delivery, and environmental

                                                                                                    Page 3 of 21

sustainability and resilience. The first and second program objectives would contribute to the second CPF
pillar, inclusive public service delivery. The third to fifth program objectives would contribute to the first CPF
pillar, private sector performance and job creation.


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

Table 1: Prior Actions (PAs) and Indicative Triggers (ITs)

PDO 1 - To strengthen the crisis response framework for better health outcomes.

      Togo had 1,528 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases (172.7 per million for a population of 8.3 million)
       in September 2020.
      PA1 – Togo undertook three measures to address the health crisis. First, the Government created a
       national committee to coordinate and manage the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
       Ministry of Public Health and Hygiene prepared the COVID-19 Emergency Preparedness and Response
       Plan with the assistance of the WHO, UNICEF, and the Bank. The national committee would oversee
       the execution of the response plan. Second, the Government introduced a COVID-19 surveillance and
       contract tracing system. Surveillance involved the systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and
       dissemination of health data to help guide public health decision making and action. Contact tracing
       would allow the authorities to gather data about the infection and how it spread. Third, the Government
       launched a COVID-19 laboratory diagnostic and case management system. Considering the early stage
       of the pandemic the initial steps were appropriate measures aligned with early WHO guidance to the
       international community, including on country-level coordination, surveillance and rapid response, and
       national laboratory systems (WHO, February 2020, 2019 Novel Coronavirus Strategic Preparedness
       and Response Plan). The relevance of PA1 is rated Highly Satisfactory.
      PA2 – All regional health directors designated and secured facilities in each region as isolation
       centers. Quarantine and isolations were part of WHO protocols at that time (WHO, Contact Tracing and
       Quarantine in the Context of COVID-19: Interim Guidance) and were included in Togo's COVID-19
       Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. In the context of prevailing health protocols, the
       relevance of PA2 is rated Satisfactory.

PDO 2 – To mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis.

      The Government estimated that 62,000 jobs were affected by the health and economic crisis (because
       of business shutdowns, area lockdowns, lower business volume), mostly in the informal sector (which
       accounted for 78 percent of male workers and 96 percent of female workers outside of agriculture).
      PA3 – A new temporary emergency cash transfer program, the NOVISSI program, targeted three
       groups disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: informal workers in micro and small
       enterprises, daily wage workers including hawkers at markets and motorbike taxi drivers, and small
       enterprise owners forced to close their businesses fully or partially. The Government would devise and
       operate a digital platform using mobile money to deliver the cash transfers every two weeks, estimated
       at 30 percent of the minimum wage for eligible men and 35 percent of the minimum income for eligible
       women. The relevance of PA3 is rated Satisfactory.
      PA4 – The extension of the cash transfers under the Safety Nets and Basic Services Project, using the
       Government's own resources, for a period of six months in rural areas would provide temporary
       emergency assistance to poor households affected by the health and economic crisis in rural
       areas. The Project had assisted 52,000 households in 685 of the poorest communities in the country in
       2019, about 8 percent of all poor households and 22 percent of the poorest households. The temporary
       extension would cover all 90,000 households eligible for cash transfers, adding 38,000 to the current
       roll. The benefits were estimated at CFAF 5,000 per household per month, representing 20 percent of

                                                                                                 Page 5 of 21

      the consumption of a household at the poverty line in rural areas. The temporary extension would
      continue to be implemented by National Agency for Grassroots Development Support. The relevance of
      PA4 is rated Satisfactory.
     PA5 – The Togolese Water Company and the Electricity Power Company of Togo waived water and
      electricity charges to vulnerable households for at least three months during the period of health
      emergency, with the costs borne by the Government through the budget. Water was deemed vital to
      mitigating the spread of COVID-19, by maintaining sanitary conditions at home and for operating some
      life-sustaining devices. Electricity was considered equally essential for operating medical equipment,
      refrigerating medicines, refrigerating food, delivering digital services, and enabling remote work and
      distance education when offices and schools were closed. The free water included water delivered at
      public stand posts (thus primarily benefitting poor households) and water delivered through private
      connections, albeit limited to below 10 cubic meters at the normal tariff. The free electricity covered the
      first 40 kilowatt hours of electricity consumption considered the basic lifeline consumption in Togo.
      Because the Togolese Water Company and the Electricity Power Company of Togo were in financial
      distress, the subsidy –– estimated at CFAF 4,760 (US$8.15) per household per month – would be
      funded by the Government. The prior action lacked stricter filters that would have better assured that
      the subsidy benefitted the most vulnerable. A subsidy for the first 40 kilowatt hours of electricity
      consumption did not exclude non-poor consumers. However, these were minor shortcomings given the
      circumstances. The relevance of PA5 is rated Satisfactory.

PDO 3 - To lay the foundations for economic recovery – in food and agriculture, by guaranteeing access
to agricultural inputs.

     PA6 comprised a two-part measure to help boost agricultural production and ensure food security in the
      face of disruptions to agricultural supply chains and local food markets triggered by the COVID-19
      health and economic crisis. First, the Government enrolled an additional 250,000 farmers in
      YOLIM ("harvest" in the Kabiye language) – the digital interest-free loan program launched in July
      2020 to support production across smallholder farms by funding the cost of farming essentials (seeds,
      fertilizers, and pesticides sufficient for one hectare of maize, rice, soybeans, or cotton production). The
      interest-free loan was issued in the fictive currency YOLIM to ensure that the credit would be used
      to purchase agricultural supplies (i.e., not converted to cash and used for other purposes). Second., the
      Government (the Ministry of Digital Economy and two GSM carriers) established an electronic platform
      that conveyed the loans of up to CFAF 97,000 to farmers using an electronic wallet. The platform was
      also be used to facilitate tractor rentals by farmers and to deliver online training and advisory services
      on "climate smart agriculture." The loan program aimed to mitigate credit constraints faced by farmers
      in the 2020-21 cropping season. Although the objective was relevant, there were two problems with the
      design of this prior action that reduced its impact: (a) the scheme was highly dependent on the ability of
      the crop aggregator (to whom the farmer was affiliated and who bought the produce from the farmer) to
      guarantee the loan and repay the credit (on behalf of the farmer) at harvest time – during the crisis, it
      was difficult for any crop aggregator to provide the guarantee cover; and (b) the loan program and the
      farmer advisory service would be conveyed through a new digital platform different from the electronic
      wallet system used in the old subsidy scheme – construction and rollout of the new platform would take
      time. Hence, the relevance of PA6 is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

Objective 4 - To lay the foundations for economic recovery in public finance.

     PA7 consisted of two measures to simplify tax payments by medium and large firms by digitalizing tax
      payments by enterprises. Firms were over-burdened by administrative procedures in paying taxes –

                                                                                                  Page 6 of 21

         they had to comply with 49 tax payments per year, compared to an average 36 in the Sub-Saharan
        Africa region, according to the Bank Doing Business Report 2020. Following the creation of an e-
        service platform by the Togolese Revenue Agency (OTR), the Government required medium and large
        enterprises to pay taxes on-line starting in November 2018. The e-service platform had been tested and
        made operational with the participation of major banks and mobile payment companies, and the launch
        had been supported by several public information campaigns. To make online tax payments and other
        online transactions secure and to help safeguard data from cyber-attacks and other data security
        breaches, the National Assembly enacted a new law regulating the collection, processing, transmission,
        storage, and use of personal data. Additionally, a Personal Data Protection Authority would be
        established to administer the new law. Technical assistance for institutional strengthening of the OTR,
        the Ministry of Finance, and the new Authority would be provided by the Togo Economic Governance
        Project, funded by the IDA and a European Union Trust Fund, and implemented in 2017-
        2023. Although the laws enabling digitalization were enacted prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19
        pandemic – Revised 2019 Finance Law n2019-D19 in November 2019 and Law n2019-014 in October
        2019 – the intent was to hasten their implementation in 2020, with particular relevance to the drive
        during COVID-19 to advance the digitalization of government services in response to the disruptions
        to manual operations. The digitalization of tax services particularly by large and medium enterprises
        would help the economic recovery effort. The relevance of PA7 is rated Satisfactory.
       PA8 consisted of two measures – the publication of an annual debt report and the publication of an
        annual risk statement – to improve debt transparency and debt management in Togo. The two new
        reports would discuss implementation of the Medium-Term Debt Strategy, finances of state-owned
        enterprises, and fiscal risks including contingent liabilities. The urgency of the debt reporting
        measures and the debt transparency objective supported by this operation were not well articulated in
        the appraisal documents. The closest link that this objective had to the government’s priorities in the
        context of COVID-19 were contained in the Letter of Intent sent by the Government to the IMF
        requesting an augmentation of access to resources following the last review of the ECF arrangement in
        March 2020: “Our fiscal policy will aim at pursuing fiscal consolidation to reduce debt vulnerabilities
        while stepping up health spending to address COVID-19 and protecting social spending.” Even then,
        the focus of policy was debt management rather than transparency. Hence, the relevance of PA8 is
        rated Unsatisfactory.

Objective 1 - To strengthen the crisis response framework for better health outcomes.

      RI1 – the number of cases tested for COVID-19 by designated testing sites per 100,000 population
       – was adequate to measure the impact of creating a national committee for the coordination and
       the management of the COVID-19 response, introducing a surveillance and contact tracing
       system, and organizing a laboratory diagnostics and case management system. The indicator is
       also adequate to reflect the degree of achievement of the objective to strengthen the response
       framework for better health outcomes. The relevance of RI1 is rated Satisfactory.
      RI2 – the percentage of all confirmed COVID-19 cases managed in designated isolation centers –
        was adequate to measure the impact of securing isolation centers in each region. The indicator is
       also adequate to reflect the degree of achievement of the objective to strengthen the response
       framework for better health outcomes. The relevance of RI2 is rated Satisfactory.

Objective 2 - To mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis.

      RI3 – the number of individuals registered receiving temporary income support in response to the
       COVID-19 pandemic – was adequate to measure the impact of the new temporary emergency
       cash transfer program NOVISSI, launched by the Government in April 2020 to help alleviate the
       adverse impact of the health and economic crisis on jobs and earnings of mostly informal sector
       workers in urban areas. The indicator was also adequate to reflect the achievement of the
       objective to mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis. The relevance of RI3 is
       rated Satisfactory.
      RI4 – the proportion of women receiving cash transfers from the NOVISSI program – added a
       gender dimension to RI3 and was adequate to measure the impact of the new temporary
       emergency cash transfer program NOVISSI on women adversely affected by the health and
       economic crisis. The indicator was also adequate to reflect the achievement of the objective to
       mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis. This results indicator was introduced
       by the ICR to replace the original results indicator, share of women with mobile money accounts,
       which could not be measured for lack of data. The relevance of RI4 is rated Satisfactory.
      RI5 – the number of households in rural areas receiving cash transfers from the Safety Nets and
       Basic Services Project was adequate to measure the impact of the temporary extension of
       emergency cash transfers under the Project. The indicator was also adequate to reflect the
       achievement of the objective to mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis. The
       relevance of RI5 is rated Satisfactory.
      RI6 – the number of vulnerable households benefitting from the temporary suspension of billing for
       electricity was only partly adequate to measure the impact of the temporary waiver of user charges
       for electricity and water – there was no equivalent results indicator for vulnerable households
       benefitting from the temporary suspension of billing for water. The relevance of RI6 is
       rated Moderately Satisfactory.

                    RI7 – the number of households receiving [purchasing] seeds and fertilizers – was adequate to
                      measure the impact of enrolling additional households on YOLIM and establishing a digital
                      platform for the provisioning of inputs and advisory services (YOLIM provides a "non-cashable"
                      zero-interest credit to eligible producers through an electronic wallet, to purchase key agricultural
                      inputs). The indicator was also adequate to reflect the achievement of the objective to lay the
                      foundations for economic recovery by guaranteeing access to agricultural inputs in 2020-21. The
                      relevance of RI7 is rated Satisfactory.

               Objective 4 - To lay the foundations for economic recovery in public finance.

                    RI8 – the number of tax payments firms needed to comply with per year – was a poor indicator to
                      measure the impact of the prior action to digitalize tax payments. The online declaration and
                      payment of taxes would reduce the time to pay taxes but not the number of tax payments. The
                      relevance of RI8 is rated Unsatisfactory.

                    RI9 – deviation of realized external-to-domestic debt from the target maximum external-to-
                      domestic debt published in the Medium-Term Debt Strategy – would not be an expected result of
                      the two transparency measures supported by this operation. The publication of an annual debt
                      report and the publication of an annual risk statement cannot, by themselves, be expected to result
                      in a changed composition of public debt between external and domestic debt. The results
                      indicator would have been the impact of a debt management prior action - as distinguished from a
                      debt transparency prior action alone - for which there was none in this operation. The relevance of
                      RI9 is rated Unsatisfactory.

                Rationale
                The operation achieved the targets for two results indicators.

                      RI1 – The number of cases tested for COVID-19 by designated testing sites per 100,000 population
                       reached 2,149 in 2020, exceeding the target of 1,000. Designated testing sites conducted 177,896
                       tests by end December 2020 for a population of 8.3 million. The degree of achievement of the target
                       is rated High.
                      RI2 – The percentage of confirmed COVID-19 cases managed in designated isolation centers

Rating

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To mitigate the negative poverty and social impacts of the crisis.

Rationale
The operation achieved the targets for three of the four results indicators.

      RI3 – The number of individuals registered receiving temporary income support in response to the
       COVID-19 pandemic reached 572,852 in 2020, exceeding the target of 500,000. The NOVISSI
       program ("solidarity' in the Ewe language), the country's digital emergency cash transfer payment
       system, delivered CFAF 11.4 billion in cash transfers to the beneficiaries, mostly informal sector
       workers and housekeepers in urban areas, over four months from April to September 2020. The
       degree of achievement of the target is rated High.
      RI4 – The proportion of women receiving cash transfers from the NOVISSI program was 63 percent in
       2020, exceeding the target of 50 percent. The degree of achievement of the target is rated High.
      RI5 – The number of households in rural areas receiving cash transfers from the Safety Nets and
       Basic Services Project increased from 52,000 in 2019 to 60,419 in 2020 (PA4 extended the Project for
       six months in rural areas), partly achieving the target of 90,000. While NOVISSI program used digital
       solutions, the Safety Nets and Basic Services Project, which focused on rural areas, continued to
       rely on physical interactions for a large part of its operations. With under 25 percent of the targeted
       increment achieved, the degree of achievement of the target is rated Negligible.
      RI6 – The number of vulnerable households benefitting from the temporary suspension of billing for
       electricity reached 310,319 per month on average in 2020 (227,897 in April 2020, 359,958 in May
       2020, and 343,101 in June), exceeding the target of 100,000. The ICR added the following
       information, although these were not formal results indicators for the operation, and hence had no
       corresponding targets: (a) the number of vulnerable households benefitting from the
       temporary suspension of billing for water reached 101,160 on average in 2020 (April - June), and (b)
       the number of vulnerable households benefitting from free water at standpipes of the Togolese Water
       Company was 2,2489 in 2020 (April - June). The degree of achievement of the target is rated High.

To lay the foundations for economic recovery – in food and agriculture, by guaranteeing access to agricultural
inputs.

Rationale
The operation did not achieve the target for this results indicator.

      RI7 – The number of households receiving seeds and fertilizers reached 4,997 in 2020, under 2
       percent of the target of an additional 250,000. In end-2020, only 57,696 farmers were registered on
       YOLIM and only 4,997 received loans that would enable them to pay for seeds and fertilizers. The
       ICR offered the following reasons for the failure to achieve the target: (a) it was difficult for
       aggregators, in times of crisis, to obtain bank guarantees that would allow their affiliated farmers to
       obtain credit from the program and buy farm inputs; (b) the aggregators were reluctant to buy inputs
       for farmers without knowing them (farmers were sometimes randomly assigned to aggregators); (c)
       the target was overly ambitious; (d) the digital platform was launched late after the agricultural
       campaign and the communication drive was poor. The degree of achievement of the target is rated
       Negligible.



Rating

Highly Unsatisfactory

OBJECTIVE 4
Objective
To lay the foundations for economic recovery – in public finance.

Rationale




The operation exceeded the target for this indicator.

      RI8 – The number of tax payments that firms needed to comply with per year was reduced from 49 in
       the baseline to 10 by closing, exceeding the target reduction to 35. Specifically: (a) the number of
       payments for the value added tax (VAT) was reduced from 12 to 1; (b) the number of payments for
       social security contributions was reduced from 12 to 1; and (c) the number pf payments for the
       corporate income tax was reduced from 5 to 1. With the digitalization requirement: (a) the proportion
       of medium-sized companies using tele-declaration rose from 41.4 percent in 2019 to 73.3 percent in
       2021; and (b) the proportion of medium-sized firms using tele-payment rose from 23.6 percent in 2019
       to 47.6 percent in 2021. Notably, corporate income tax revenues increased by 31.1 percent over
       2019-21, and VAT revenues increased by 16.4 percent over 2019-2021. With the relevance of RI8
       rated unsatisfactory, the degree of achievement of the target is downgraded from high to
       Substantial. The additional evidence that tele-declarations and tele-payments rose over two years

                            compensate for the deficiency of RI8.
                           RI9 – The deviation of the realized external-to-domestic debt from the target external-to-domestic debt
                            published in the Medium-Term Debt Strategy was 65 percent in end-2021, failing to meet the target of
                            a maximum deviation of 10 percent. New external borrowing was FCFA 55.6 billion in 2021 while new
                            internal borrowing was FCFA 656.7 billion. The ratio of external to internal borrowing was
                            0.08 compared to the target ratio of 0.23. This represented a realized deviation of 65 percent versus
                            the target maximum deviation set in this program of 10 percent. Public debt consisted mainly of
                            domestic debt at the start of this program, 65.8 percent of total debt in 2019. However, domestic debt,
                            especially public securities issued in the sub-regional market, were typically of short maturity and
                            carried high interest rates. To help ease debt service, the Government aimed to shift borrowing to
                            external sources with concessional terms. External debt rose from 34.2 percent of total debt in 2019
                            to 38.4 percent in 2020 before falling back to 36.5 percent at the end of this program in 2021. The
                            slow progress did not help with target ratio. The ICR cites tightening global financial conditions in
                            2021 as one explanatory factor. Apart from the poor link of the results indicator to the prior
                            actions (see Section 4), the poor outturn means that the degree of achievement of the target is rated
                            Negligible.

Overall Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)
Rationale

Because the main thrust of this operation was to address immediate critical needs from COVID-19, greater

The degree of achievement of the first objective to strengthen the crisis response framework for better health
outcomes is rated highly satisfactory, and the second objective to mitigate the negative poverty and social
impacts of the crisis, moderately satisfactory. These objectives are given a weight of 33 percent each.

The degree of achievement of the objective to lay the foundations for economic recovery – in food and
agriculture is rated highly unsatisfactory, and in public finance, moderately unsatisfactory. These objectives –
 parsed into two from the original objective "to lay the foundations for economic recovery" – are given a weight of

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The outcomes for the three measures aimed at laying the foundations for economic recovery face moderate
to substantial sustainability risks following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (the WHO lifted
the global health emergency declaration for COVID-19 on May 5, 2023).

      The YOLIM program barely extended any interest-free credit to 250,000 farmers for seeds, fertilizers,
       and pesticides for the 2020-21 cropping season. The YOLIM program has not since been used
       and might not continue as a credit subsidy scheme in its current form.
      The digitalization of tax declarations was taken up by three fourths of medium sized firms, and tax
       payments, by half, by 2021. The expected next step would be the extension of the digitalization drive
       to other taxpayer groups, including small enterprises. But that would face considerable hurdles and
       risks, including that internet penetration in Togo is only about 26 percent.
      The publication of the annual debt report and annual risk statement in 2021 were important steps
       toward debt transparency and will likely be sustained moving forward. Continuing technical
       assistance by the multi-donor trust fund Debt Management Facility to the Department of Public Debt
       and Financing will likely be needed.

Considering that the Government did not provide the quarterly progress reports agreed upon with the Bank
during program implementation (see Section 8.B), assessing the development impact in the medium-term of
the reforms supported by this operation would be difficult.

Choice of Prior Actions and Results Indicators. This operation suffered from shortcomings at design.

      PA8 consisted of reform measures that were completed in 2019, way ahead of the COVID-19
       pandemic that erupted in 2020. Their inclusion in this operation as prior actions that would form
       part of the Government’s response to the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is not
       credible. They did not represent any incremental actions that would help the country recover from
       the crisis (see Section 3.B).
      The original RI4 would be difficult to measure at implementation (see Section 8.B).
      RI8 was unrelated to the prior action to digitalize tax payments (see Section 4).
      RI9 could not be the result of debt transparency measures (see Section 4). Moreover, it would be
       difficult to measure at implementation (see Section 8.B).

Analytical Underpinning. The prior actions were informed by analytic work produced by the WHO, the
Bank, and the IMF.

      PA1 – COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (WHO, February
         2020) and Strengthening Preparedness for COVID-19 in Cities and Urban Settings (WHO, April
         2020) advocated adopting a coordinated, multi-sectoral, whole-of-government, and whole-of-
         society approach to ensure coherence of measures across different levels of government and to
         promote the public's willingness to comply with mitigation mandates. WHO guidance backed the
         idea, under PA1, of creating the national committee for the coordination and the management of
         the national COVID-19 response.
        PA1 and PA2 – Critical Preparedness, Readiness and Response Actions for COVID-19 (WHO,
         March 2020) argued for a national public health preparedness and response plan
         to guide government and citizen actions. WHO guidance and protocols also informed the other
         measures supported by PA1 and PA2: (a) public health surveillance – Responding to Community
         Spread of COVID-19 (WHO, March 2020); (b) contact tracing – Contact Tracing and Quarantine in
         the Context of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020); (c) laboratory diagnostics – Laboratory Testing Strategy
         Recommendations for COVID-19 (WHO, March 2020); (d) case management system – Operational
         Considerations for Case Management of COVID-19 in Health Facility and Community (WHO,
         March 2020); and (e) isolation centers and treatment facilities – Severe Acute Respiratory
         Infections Treatment Centre (WHO, March 2020).
        PA3 – Social Protection and Jobs Responses to COVID-19: A Real-Time Review of Country
         Measures (Gentilini et al., April 2020) found that cash transfers were the most widely used
         intervention by governments globally for social protection and assistance during the crisis. The
         Economic Policy Response to the COVID-19 Crisis (World Bank, 2020) recommended using
         existing structures and social safety nets, where available, as well as new local and community-
         driven channels and mechanisms for delivering assistance. These findings informed PA3, which
         supported a new temporary emergency cash transfer program in urban areas.
        PA4 – Assessing the Economic Impact of COVID-19 and Policy Responses in Sub-Saharan Africa
         (World Bank, April 2020) advocated implementing social protection programs for workers,
         especially in the informal sector, to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the poor. The report
         supported PA4 extending safety nets in rural areas, where informality dominated most economic
         activity.
        PA5 – The Economic Policy Response to the COVID-19 Crisis (World Bank, 2020) and Togo
         Strategic Diagnostic for Water, Sanitation, and Water Resources (World Bank, 2020) stated that the
         resilience of households during the crisis depended on their retaining access to water and

                                                                                                  Page 16 of 21

         sanitation, electricity, and broadband services. The two studies supported PA5, ensuring access to
         water and electricity for the most vulnerable households.

Link to Other Bank Operations in Togo. The prior actions supported by this operation were aligned with
the objectives and activities of other active Bank operations in Togo.

      PA1 and PA2 provided the policy framework to underpin Bank projects that would help Togo
         respond to the COVID-19 public health crisis, albeit not after the first emergency project was rolled
         out. The Togo COVID-19 Emergency Response and Systems Preparedness Strengthening
         Project, approved ahead of this operation in April 2020, supported the activation of an emergency
         operations center, the acquisition of prefabricated treatment and isolation centers, the purchase
         and installation of laboratory equipment, the provision of drugs and supplies to public health
         facilities, and the training of rapid response teams. Togo also obtained support from the Second
         Phase of Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) Project for Africa,
         approved earlier in 2017, to strengthen the national and regional capacity for collaborative disease
         surveillance and epidemic preparedness in West Africa. The country tapped the emergency
         component of the project to purchase ambulances, mobile laboratories, personal protective
         equipment, and masks, among other equipment and supplies. Togo also used the project to
         refurbish treatment centers and to train staff at regional and district hospitals and health facilities
         on surveillance, prevention, and control (case investigation and contact tracing).
        Beneficiary data derived from the implementation PA3 and PA4 would feed into the unified social
         registry planned under the West African Unique Identification for Regional Integration and Inclusion
         (WURI) Phase II Project. Approved likewise in 2020, the project aimed to increase the number of
         persons who had a government-recognized proof of unique identity that facilitated their access to
         services.
        PA4 used the Safety Nets and Basic Services Project, approved in 2017, to deliver temporary
         emergency cash transfers to poor households in rural areas.
        PA6 would subsidize credit to keep food and agriculture supply chains running during the
         crisis. Meanwhile, the Togo Agriculture Support Project, approved in 2017, aimed to rehabilitate
         productive capacities across selected value chains in agriculture and foster an enabling
         environment for the investment in the agricultural sector.
        Technical assistance for institutional strengthening delivered to the Togolese Revenue Authority
         and the Ministry of Finance by the Togo Economic Governance Project, approved in 2018, would
         serve to sustain the implementation of PA7. The project also supported the archiving of taxpayer
         files.

Operational Risks and Mitigation Measures. The Bank assessed the operational risk to the operation to
be substantial overall.

      To address governance risk and fiduciary risk, which it rated as substantial, the Bank proposed
         that: (a) all COVID-19 related expenses be channeled through the regular state budget to
         follow regular public financial management processes; (b) a supplemental budget be prepared to
         account for the unexpected spending and decline in revenues induced by the COVID-19 response;
         and (c) independent auditors conduct audits of the foreign currency dedicated accounts established
         for this operation. The Bank considered similar arrangements made for the preceding Togo COVID-
         19 Emergency Response and Systems Preparedness Strengthening Project to be effective risk
         mitigation measures for this operation.

      Togo Emergency Covid-19 DPO 2021 (P174376)



The project experience shows that the severity of at least two risk factors were underestimated at design.

      Technical design risk was originally assessed as moderate. However, the targets for social
       protection in rural areas (RI5) and support for agricultural inputs (RI7) proved to be overly
       ambitious, considering the severity of the crisis, the mobility and activity restrictions in response to
       the crisis, and the constraints on government administrative, staff, and budgetary resources.
      The assessment of institutional capacity risk for implementation should have been more
       nuanced. All policy decision issued by Presidential decree (e.g., PA1, PA3, and PA5) were readily
       adopted, while those promulgated through ministerial orders (e.g., PA4, PA6, and PA8) took longer
       to implement, reflecting the centralization of power in the presidency.

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Supervision. Bank sector specialists (who supervised ongoing Bank health, social protection, agriculture,
energy, and public finance operations in Togo) supervised the implementation of this program.

Monitoring Implementation. Two indicators proved difficult to measure at implementation – the share of
women with mobile money accounts (the original RI4) and deviation of realized from target external-to-domestic
debt composition () – and could have been revised or adjusted earlier. The ICR relayed that the Government
did not provide the quarterly progress reports agreed upon with the Bank.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR did not present evidence to assess the ex-post poverty and social impact of this
operation. The COVID-19 pandemic likely increased poverty by 4 percentage points in 2020-2021 and
disproportionately affected urban populations, based on simulations (World Bank, Macro Poverty Outlook - Sub-
Saharan Africa, April 2022). The ICR reiterated that PA3, PA4, and PA5 served poor individuals and
households, implying that the poverty outcome could have probably been worse; but the actual impacts were not
measured.



b. Environmental

The ICR did not present evidence to assess the ex-post environmental impact of this operation. The ICR
offered the following observations: (a) the Ministry of Health adopted a medical waste management plan related to
PA1 and PA2; (c) about PA5, the lack of access to electricity would have prompted households to use firewood for
cooking; and (c) the program promoted the use of organic fertilizers in PA6.



c. Gender

The program had several positive impacts on gender, based on the results indicators: (a) 63 percent of NOVISSI
program beneficiaries were women, exceeding the target of 50 percent (see Section 4 - Objective 2 - RI4); (b)
women beneficiaries of the NOVISSI program received larger cash transfers per capita than men (see Section 3.B
- Objective 2 - PA3); (c) the majority of beneficiaries from the extension of cash transfers under Safety Nets and
Basic Services Project in rural areas were women – 58,697 out of 61,317 total beneficiaries, according to the ICR;
(d) there was no data to verify that the percentage of women with mobile accounts increased (this indicator was
revised).

The ICR is consistent with OPCS guidelines on ICRs for development financing operations and includes

actions and the results indicators are fairly extensive.


                                                                                                    Page 19 of 21

The account of the project’s performance is well informed and concisely presented.

The efficacy assessment is outcome-oriented and based on the degree of achievement of the results
targets. Explanations for the failure to achieve some results targets are highly informative.

The ICR presents ample evidence to support its assessment of the Bank’s performance at design and during
implementation. The enumeration of the analytic underpinnings of the operation, the connection with other
Bank operations in Togo, and the coordination with other international donors are fairly detailed.

The assessment of the efficacy of the program is candid and evidence-based.

The ICR draws lessons that would be valuable development policy operations designed to address a crisis.

12. Lessons

Three lessons are drawn from the ICR, with some adaptation.

Digitalization can deliver emergency cash transfers to poor and vulnerable household
beneficiaries effectively and efficiently. In this project, the success of digitalization was even more notable
as was it attained during a crisis: (a) NOVISSI was a hundred percent digital cash transfer program with no face-
to-face contact from registration to eligibility assessment to cash payment; (b) the rollout was speedy –
developed in-house, the platform was operational in 10 days; (c) the payouts were nearly instantaneous – once
declared eligible, beneficiaries received cash transfers on their mobile accounts in less than two minutes; (d) the
platform functioned without the internet (internet penetration in Togo was only about 26 percent) – it used low-
tech mobile technologies such as unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) to enable beneficiaries with
basic 2G telephones to register by dialing a short code to access a special menu, helping compensate for the
poor state of digital tools particularly in rural areas; and (e) it leveraged cell phone metadata, satellite imagery,
and machine learning to improve the targeting of beneficiaries. According to the International Monetary


                                                                                                      Page 20 of 21

Fund, NOVISSI platform was a model technological innovation (Technology Driven Development, Finance and

Balancing ambition with realism is needed in a development policy operation designed in response to a
crisis. In this operation, the YOLIM program was overly ambitious in the difficult context of the COVID-19
health and economic crisis: (a) this operation aimed to enroll an additional 250,000 farmers in the YOLIM
agricultural input subsidy scheme within a year (2021) – it took the predecessor Agri-PME scheme three years
to recruit an equal number of 250,000 participants (2016-2019); (b) doubling farmer participation in the
government agricultural program was ambitious during a crisis marked by area lockdowns, activity restraints,
and mobility restrictions, and punctuated by high economic uncertainty; (c) rather than provide cash subsidies to
farmers as the Agri-PME scheme did for fertilizers, YOLIM would extend interest-free loans for the purchase of
seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, and for the rental of farm machinery – except that crop aggregators (to whom
farmers must be affiliated and who purchased the farmers' produce and acted as guarantor of the YOLIM loans)
could not readily obtain bank loans during the crisis; (d) to accommodate the targets, crop aggregators were
assigned to farmers with whom they were not previously acquainted – this random assignment of farmers to
aggregators slowed the uptake by the farmers of the loan scheme as the farmers would have needed time to
establish commercial ties with the “new” aggregators, according to the ICR; and (e) rather than deliver the
assistance through the existing electronic wallet system used in the Agri-PME scheme, this operation opted to
construct a new digital platform that would also convey advisory services to farmers about "climate smart
agriculture" – constructing the platform took time and it was launched late in the planting season.

Strong institutional arrangements in the health sector are vital to collaboration and coordination in
crisis response operations. In this operation, the successful implementation of health measures can be
attributed to the close collaboration among the implementing agencies and stakeholders. The creation of the
National Committee (of 28 members from all agencies), responsible for the coordination and the management
of the COVID-19 response, was key to this achievement. A Technical Unit headed by the Minister of
Health was also created to manage the response actions at the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene. Several
other institutional arrangements strengthened the crisis response – the National Council chaired by the
President, the Scientific Council to inform health decisions, the Committee in charge of managing material and
sanitary equipment, and Local Management Committees led by prefects. Moreover, each ministry had also its
own Crisis Management Unit.
