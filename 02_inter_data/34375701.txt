2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The program development objective (PDO) of the programmatic Republic of Togo First Fiscal Management and
Energy Reform Development Policy Financing (DPF) was: (i) enhancing fiscal and debt management; and (ii)
strengthening energy sector financial viability and use of renewable energy. For the Togo Second Fiscal
Management and Infrastructure Reform DPF, the PDO was revised: (i) enhancing fiscal and debt management;
and (ii) improving financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors.

For the purpose of this ICR Review the PDOs are taken as follows:

      PDO1: To enhance fiscal and debt management.
      PDO2: To improve financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The program had two pillars:

Pillar 1: Enhancing Fiscal and Debt Management supported reforms to: (a) strengthen tax revenue
mobilization by improving the design and management of tax expenditures, including exemptions to the Value
Added Tax (VAT), and by increasing revenues from property taxes; (b) improve public investment; and (c)
improve public debt management.


                                                                                                    Page 2 of 25

     Togo First DPF 2019 (P169867)



Pillar 2: Strengthening Energy Sector Financial Viability and the Use of Renewable Energy (at the first
operation) / Improving Financial Viability and Service Delivery in the Energy and Water Sectors (after the
second operation) supported reforms to: (a) increase energy efficiency and improve the financial performance of
the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo; and (b) improve water service delivery and strengthen the financial
viability of the water sector.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

Program Cost and Financing. The first operation was in the amount of US$150 million at appraisal and was
financed by an International Development Association (IDA) development policy credit of Euro (EUR) 56.1
million (US$87.5 million equivalent), which was fully disbursed (US$88.2 million equivalent), and an IDA
development policy grant of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 63.5 million (US$62.5 million equivalent), which was
fully disbursed (US$62.8 million equivalent). The second operation was in the amount of US$100 million and
was financed by an IDA development policy credit of EUR44.9 million (US$50 million equivalent, which was fully
disbursed (US$47.9 million equivalent), and an IDA development policy grant of SDR36 million (US$50 million
equivalent), which was fully disbursed (US$46.6 million equivalent). The differences in US$ amounts between
approval and closing dates were due to changes in the EUR/US$ and SDR/US$ rates over the program period.

Dates. The first operation was approved on December 16, 2019, became effective on December 18, 2019, and
closed on December 31, 2020, two weeks after the original closing date of December 15, 2020. The second
operation was approved on March 30, 2022, became effective on April 22, 2022, and closed as scheduled on
March 31, 2023.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 A small open low-income economy in the Sahel, Togo faced fiscal headwinds at appraisal. Domestic revenue
 mobilization (DRM) averaged 16.8 percent of GDP over the period 2015-2019, and fiscal deficits, 2.6 percent
 of GDP. Debt was at 54 percent of GDP in 2019. Despite stable economic growth averaging 5 percent GDP
 over 2015-2019 and per capita growth averaging 2.2 percent GDP over the same period, delivering public
 services to a fast-growing population of 8 million (with an annual population growth rate of 2.4 percent) was a
 challenge. Access to adequate electricity services stood at 52.5 percent in 2019 and access to clean water
 was only 18.3 percent.

 Binding Constraints to Development. The development objective to enhance fiscal and debt management
 and improve financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors was responsive to the
 binding constraints to development identified in the Togo Systematic Country Diagnostic 2016 (SCD):
 "weaknesses in fiscal governance" (Key Constraint 2 (of 5)) and "high and distortionary taxation" (Key
 Constraint 4). The SCD also listed "costly and unreliable electricity provision" and "deficits in the provision of
 water and sanitation" as "moderate infrastructure services constraints."

 Country Priorities. The development objective was consistent with the country's development priorities
 articulated in the Plan National de Développement 2018-2022 (PND). The development
 objectives to enhance fiscal and debt management and to improve financial viability and service delivery

in the energy and water sectors were consistent with the second PND pillar -- Boost the productivity and
competitiveness of growth sectors -- and the third PND pillar -- Strengthen infrastructure to support growth.

World Bank Group Strategy. The project development objective was aligned with the World Bank Group
country strategy in Togo at appraisal.

       The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the Republic of Togo FY17-FY20 organized the World
        Bank Group support for the country's development strategy around three "focus areas": Private Sector
        Performance and Job Creation, Inclusive Public Service Delivery, and Environmental Sustainability
        and Resilience. The objectives to enhance fiscal and debt management and to improve financial
        viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors were aligned with the first CPF focus
        area, specifically with the CPF Objective 1 "to strengthen fiscal policy and debt management" and
        CPF Objective 2 "to strengthen energy, ICT, and logistics services."

PDO1: To enhance fiscal and debt management.

Tax Revenue Mobilization: Weak tax revenue mobilization hampered Togo's ability to finance its development
agenda in a stable, predictable, and sustainable manner: (a) at 13 percent of GDP in 2019, tax revenues in
Togo remained well below the average for the Sub Saharan Africa region (16 percent of GDP) and the target
for WAEMU countries (20 percent of GDP); (b) tax expenditures – reductions in tax liabilities relative to a
benchmark system, including tax exemptions, tax allowances, tax credits, tax rate relief, and tax deferrals –
were ineffective and had little impact on investment and growth -- after declining from 2.5 percent of GDP in
2017 to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2019, tax expenditures rose again to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2020 following the
onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (c) property taxes an equitable and efficient means of raising
revenues – remained small at 0.1 percent of GDP in 2019, compared to the average in the Sub Saharan
Africa region (0.4 percent of GDP). Four reforms would boost tax revenue mobilization -- two PAs to reform
the VAT system and related tax administration and two PAs to reform property taxes.

PA1: The adoption of a single statutory rate for the VAT at 18 percent, the elimination of the old preferential
rate on the VAT for certain products of 10 percent, and the creation of a dedicated single account for the
payment of VAT credits would rationalize and simplify the VAT system, streamline the refund process for VAT
credits, and increase transparency, helping raise VAT revenues and total revenues. VAT revenues, which
accounted for 43 percent of all tax revenues, stood at only 8 percent of GDP, its potential weakened by: (a)
multiple VAT rates that injected complexity into the system and raised compliance costs, reducing the tax
base; (b) VAT exemptions, initially focused on staple commodities (cereals, sugar, oil) but since extended to
other goods (ICT products) -- revenue losses from VAT exemptions were estimated at 1.6 percent of
GDP; and (c) a poorly functioning VAT refund system that negatively affected the competitiveness of
exporters. The reform measures would address these problems. Relevance of PA1: Satisfactory (S).

PA2: Tax administration measures would facilitate the implementation of the VAT reforms supported by PA1
-- the online tax filing and payment method would be extended to small business, and an annual report on tax
expenditures would be annexed to the 2022 Finance Law. The digitalization of tax filing and payment would
enhance tax compliance by small businesses, while the disclosure of tax expenditures would increase
transparency, allowing stakeholders to assess their effectiveness and motivating the authorities to phase out
those that were not well targeted and effective. Small firms had previously identified poor tax administration
as a hindrance to doing business, according to the Togo Enterprise Survey 2016 (World Bank, 2016), while
widespread tax expenditures, including exemptions to the VAT, weakened revenue mobilization, according to
the West Africa Tax Policy Analysis. Relevance of PA2: Satisfactory (S).

PA3: Property taxation would be reformed by merging the land census data with the land registry data and by
updating the taxpayer registry at the Office Togolais des Recettes. Digitized land titles represented only 11.6
percent of all land identified by the Office Togolais des Recettes as taxable in 2018. The harmonization of
census and registry data would create a comprehensive and up-to-date database of property information,
broadening the tax base and enhancing property tax collection. The full impact of updated cadasters and

property valuations on property tax revenues would take time to materialize, however, and higher revenues
would be posted in later years. Relevance of PA3: Satisfactory (S).

PA4: In addition to PA3, operationalizing a full-fledged fiscal cadaster (an official register of the quantity,
value, and ownership of real estate used in apportioning taxes) that integrated information on land and
property and their valuation would provide the Office Togolaise des Recettes with a powerful tool for
identifying, valuing, and taxing properties accurately. In addition, reducing the registration fees on land and
property -- the registration fee rate was reduced from 5 percent to 1.5 percent of the estimated value of land
or property in 2021 -- would encourage more people to register their properties, broadening the property tax
base. In conjunction with PA3, Relevance of PA4: Satisfactory (S).

Public Investment Management (PIM): Public investment was constrained by inefficient public procurement
and the lack of a framework for public private partnerships (PPPs), elevating fiscal risks: (a) budget
execution, especially for capital expenditures, remained low because of an ineffective public procurement
process -- the deviation of execution from budgetary plan was a high 20 percent versus 15 percent globally;
(b) the Evaluation du Système de Passation des Marchés du Togo selon la Méthodologie d’Evaluation des
Systèmes de Passation de Marche of 2020 found that 79 percent of contracts awarded were not executed
within contractual deadlines and that 50 percent of invoices were not paid in due time; and (c) meanwhile,
PPPs -- an increasing source of financing for infrastructure projects, especially energy and road projects --
had become a significant source of fiscal risk in the absence of a strong legal framework to govern PPPs, and
(d) PPP agreements were signed on an ad-hoc basis and without rigorous cost-benefit analyses and risk
assessments. Three reforms would improve public investment -- two PAs directed at public procurement,
and one PA, at PPPs.

PA5: A Code of Professional Ethics for Public Procurement, issued by decree, aimed to fight fraud and
corruption, and safeguard public trust in the fairness, integrity, and legitimacy of government procurement. A
related decree would improve the implementation of public projects delegated to third parties and strengthen
the supervision of large infrastructure projects. This latter measure would mandate competition in the
selection of delegated contracting authorities, ending the monopoly practice of single-source selection. The
intent of the two measures was to improve the efficiency and transparency of public procurement,
ensuring that public projects were completed according to specifications, and in time, and within budget.
While well-intentioned, the decrees fail to prescribe sanctions and penalties against contrary behavior.
Relevance of PA5: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA6: A new Public Procurement Law would modernize the legal framework for public procurement in Togo.
The legal update would: (a) reduce the use of non-competitive procurement methods; (b) introduce a
consultative mechanism to increase the participation of the private sector and civil society in the government
procurement process; (c) set public procurement procedures in crisis situations; and (d) introduce
environmental considerations in the procurement of goods and services. It was expected that the revised law
would reduce the time for review and approval of procurement by the control body, reduce the time for
handling bid and award complaints, expedite the procurement process to improve budget
execution, and increase transparency by disclosing procurement data in a Public Procurement Portal.
Relevance of PA6: Satisfactory (S).

PA7: A new PPP Law would create the legal framework to govern the development and implementation of
PPP projects in Togo. Among its key provisions, the new law would: (a) require cost-benefit analyses of all
PPP projects, covering not just economic but also the social and the environmental facets of PPP
investments, and (b) establish a dedicated PPP unit responsible for monitoring the preparation and


                                                                                                    Page 8 of 25

implementation of PPP projects. It is expected that an effective and transparent legal and regulatory
framework for PPPs, harmonized with regional norms and standards (i.e., WAEMU directives), and bolstered
by a capable institution, would better attract private sector investment for efficient and
sustainable infrastructure development. Relevance of PA7: Satisfactory (S).


Debt Management: Despite recent improvements -- the government reorganized the Direction de la Dette
Publique et du Financement and centralized cash flow forecasting and debt management -- debt
management and debt transparency remained challenging: (a) at 52.4 percent of GDP in 2019, public debt
remained high in Togo compared to the average in the WAEMU countries (45 percent of GDP); (b) debt
service was a major burden on the budget, exceeding half of government revenues in 2020; and (c) although
the government started the publication of an Annual Debt Strategy and a quarterly Debt Statistical Bulletin in
2018, it has not updated its Annual Borrowing Plan (ABP) nor published a Financial Risk Statement.

PA8: The government would adopt a Medium-Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) for 2019-2023 and create a Public
Debt Portal to disclose information on public and publicly guaranteed debt. In presenting the debt strategy to
Parliament, the government would estimate contingent liabilities and assess fiscal risks. The government had
committed to a fiscal consolidation and debt reduction strategy under the three-year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2017-2020. This PA would consolidate the
gains made with the IMF program, following the advice relayed at the conclusion of the IMF program that: (a)
the medium-term fiscal framework should aim to reduce the present value of total public debt below the
threshold for countries with medium debt-carrying capacity of 55 percent of GDP by 2022; (b) the MTDS
should provide detailed guidelines for specific indicators (e.g., interest rates, refinancing, foreign-currency
risks); (c) the authorities must establish a more systematic exchange of information between all stakeholders;
and (d) debt service forecasts be fully integrated with budget forecasts to reduce discrepancies between
forecasts and performance. Relevance of PA8: Satisfactory (S).

PA9: To implement the MTDS for 2019-2023 (adopted with PA8), the government would produce and publish
an ABP and a Fiscal Risk Statement, consistent with the debt strategy, starting in 2021. The borrowing plan
would set clear limits on new debt to foster fiscal discipline. Its publication would build trust around fiscal
targets and lower borrowing costs. The risk statement would identify fiscal risks, including those arising from
government guarantees and PPPs, signaling the government's commitment to responsible fiscal policy.
Technical assistance (TA) from the WBG-managed multi-donor Debt Management Facility would help
the Direction de la Dette Publique et du Financement prepare the debt strategy and produce the ABP and
risk statement. Relevance of PA9: Satisfactory (S).

PDO2: To improve financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors.

Electricity Services: Electricity services in Togo suffered from operational, financial, and economic
inefficiencies: (a) although over half the population had access to electricity by 2019, energy supply remained
unreliable -- yearly power outages (at 35 per customer in 2019) was worse than in Cote d'Ivoire (20
per customer) or Tanzania (5 per customer); (b) energy supply was also costly -- the electricity tariff,
estimated at US$0.19 per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2020, was far higher than the global average, at US$0.13
per kWh; (c) the sector was in financial distress -- the state-owned transmission and distribution utility,
Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo, which posted net losses in 2018 and 2019, faced a structural deficit
in 2020, with the average electricity tariff (US$0.19 per kWh) straddling below the average breakeven tariff
(US$0.26 per kWh); and (d) the utility suffered from operational inefficiencies -- technical and non-technical
losses were high (17 percent in 2019), wheeling charges (transmission charges) on electricity purchases


                                                                                                   Page 9 of 25

from Communauté Electrique du Bénin (co-owned by Benin and Togo) and CountourGlobal (an independent
power producer) were rising (from CFAF 4 per kWh in 2018 to CFAF 10 per kWh in 2019), operations
suffered from underpricing and bill collection losses, and debt and debt service were deteriorating (the debt-
equity ratio rose to 290 percent in 2018 from 70 percent in 2014). Seven reforms would help address the
sector's inefficiencies -- four PAs relating to sector finances, one to utility operations, and two to energy
economics.

PA10: All central government agencies, local governments, and state-owned enterprises would pay their
outstanding arrears (end-2018) to the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo, the utilities Société Togolaise
des Eaux and TOGOCOM would establish escrow accounts for the timely payment of bills to the Compagnie
Energie Electrique du Togo, and, in turn, the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo would pay its arrears
to Communauté Electrique du Bénin. This cross-arrears clearance arrangement would settle arrears which
had accumulated to US$82 million by end-2018 (a figure that, however, excluded arrears by the jointly
owned Communauté Electrique du Bénin to international suppliers of US$108 million by end-2018). The
payment of arrears with the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo and Communauté Electrique du Bénin
would shore up the finances of the sector while the creation of escrow accounts by Société Togolaise des
Eaux and TOGOCOM would help forestall the incurrence of arrears in the future. However, as the
program excludes the settlement of arrears by Communauté Electrique du Bénin to international suppliers, or
at least the formulation of a credible plan for the settlement of such arrears (i.e., subject to a joint action with
Benin), the relevance of PA10 is rated moderately satisfactory. Relevance of PA10: Moderately
Satisfactory (MS).

PA11: Following arrears clearance, the implementation of the Revenue Protection Program for large
customers, the installation of smart meters at all government agencies, and the installation of pre-paid meters
at all local governments should improve the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo's overall billing and
collection rates. Smart meters and prepaid meters are a technological improvement (over standard electric
meters) and would facilitate the timely payment of electricity bills by customers. Relevance of PA11:
Satisfactory (S).

PA12 and PA13: In addition to requiring Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo clients to pay for public
lighting (public lighting was the largest electricity expense of local governments), an administrative order
vesting the Autorité de Régulation du Secteur de la Communication Electronique et des Postes with the
authority to determine adjustments to the revenue requirements of the Compagnie Energie Electrique du
Togo (PA12), and a subsequent administrative order directing the Autorité de Régulation du Secteur de la
Communication Electronique et des Postes to establish a methodology for tariff setting (PA13) would
strengthen the drive toward financial viability in the electricity sector. The Compagnie Energie Electrique du
Togo had earlier developed a financial equilibrium model, which will thence be reviewed by the regulator, who
will propose periodic adjustments to the tariff. These PAs represent important first steps toward achieving a
convergence of costs and tariffs in electricity services, with tariff adjustments driving convergence on the
revenue side and technical and operational efficiency on the expenditure side. However, while important, the
vesting of authority and the adoption of a methodology for periodic tariff setting does not mean tariffs
have been adjusted at all, even if initially. Relevance of PA12: Moderately Satisfactory (MS); Relevance
of PA13: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA14: A Transmission Service Agreement between the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo and
the Communauté Electrique du Bénin would set the legal obligations of each firm to ensure a
technically efficient and financially sustainable transmission of electricity. Under the recent reorganization of
the electricity sectors in Togo and neighboring Benin, domestic power generation and electricity imports were

delegated (beginning in 2019) to the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo and the Société Béninoise
d'Energie Electrique, leaving the Communauté Electrique du Bénin responsible no longer for power
generation but for transmission, albeit with some residual selling from existing hydropower plants to large
consumers. Under the new business model, the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo would be obliged to
pay a wheeling charge to the Communauté Electrique du Bénin (some US$18 million were in arrears in
August 2019), the regularity of which would enable the Communauté Electrique du Bénin to invest in the
maintenance of its transmission network. In the context of the reorganized electricity markets in Togo and
Benin, the relevance of PA14 is rated satisfactory. Relevance of PA14: Satisfactory (S).

PA15: To reduce the average cost of power production, to promote efficiency as well as transparency, and to
increase the use of renewable energy, the government would update the Least Cost Power Development
Plan (LCPDP) prepared under a participatory process and to be implemented using competitive procurement
processes. The goal of the LCPDP would be to reduce the cost of electricity provision by identifying least-
cost-technology generation options for electricity supply needs that will also avoid the use of emergency
power plants. Informed by prefeasibility studies and the environmental and social screening of potential sites,
the plan would consider energy security objectives as well as environmental and social risks. Relevance of
PA15: Satisfactory (S).

PA16: To further promote the use of renewable energy, the government would strengthen the legal
framework for renewable energy generation projects. The National Assembly passed Loi No. 2018-010 to
promote the development of electricity from renewable sources and two application decrees have since been
signed, the first to set the regime under which a project falls (free, declaration, or authorization) and the
second to set the conditions and the procedures for the conclusion of concession agreements. Relevance of
PA16: Satisfactory (S). In combination, PA15 and PA16 would lower the costs of energy provision,
strengthen the financial sustainability of the sector, and promote a shift toward renewable energy.

Water Services: Water services in Togo faced operational and financial obstacles to providing quality service
and maintaining financial viability: (a) access to water was low; (b) the state-owned Togolaise des Eaux,
responsible for urban water, faced obstacles with service expansion, quality maintenance,
and highwater leakage due to an outdated infrastructure, resulting in significant losses and unreliable supply;
(c) tariffs failed to cover operating costs, leading to debt and hindered maintenance; and (d) high connection
charges created a barrier for low-income households, leaving them with expensive and often unsafe
alternatives. Two reforms would help address the sector's issues -- the first PA related to operations and
finance, and the second to access.

PA17: The government would revise the taxation of off-grid water extraction by large users to better reflect
the social and environmental cost of their consumption. The tighter regulation and the higher charges would
address two problems related to the heavy reliance by large users on freshwater aquifers: (a) many large
industrial and commercial users had tapped directly into these common and shared aquifers rather than
connect to the Société Togolaise des Eaux water supply system, but the sustainable yield of these
aquifers were uncertain; and (b) the sustainable management of water resources lacked funding and the
finances of the Société Togolaise des Eaux remained precarious. Relevance of PA17: Satisfactory (S).

PA18: The government would spread out the payment by vulnerable households of connection fees to
the Société Togolaise des Eaux network over three years. A major uptake in household connections following
a decision at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce residential connection fees from CFAF 100,000
to CFAF 25,000 suggested that connection charges were a major obstacle to water access by poor
households. This PA would maintain the financial assistance in some form without eliminating connection

PDO1 - To enhance fiscal and debt management.

RI1: While adopting a single statutory rate for VAT, eliminating the previous preferential rate, suspending the
use of VAT certificates, and creating a dedicated single account for VAT credits would help raise VAT revenues,
and ultimately total tax revenues, it is doubtful that an increase in total tax revenues, as a percentage of GDP, in
any one year or over several years, could be wholly attributed to these VAT reforms alone (PA1) or to the
associated tax administration measures (PA2) supported by this series. VAT revenues comprised only about
two-fifths of total tax revenues, implying that other taxes could drive overall tax performance as well. This results
indicator was also meant to measure the impact of the property tax reforms (PA3 and PA4). For property taxes,
whose contribution to total taxes is miniscule (three-fourths of one percent), the attribution issue is even more
pronounced. Relevance of RI1: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI2: VAT revenues, as a percentage of GDP, rather than total revenues, as a percentage of GDP, would be
a better measure of the impact of the VAT reforms on revenue performance. The Program Document (PD) for
the second operation added RI2 to the results framework for this reason. Relevance of RI2: Satisfactory (S).

RI3: Property tax revenues, as a percentage of GDP, was added at the second operation for the same reason --
this RI better reflects the impact of the property tax reforms (PA3 and PA4) on revenue performance than does
total tax revenues, as a percentage of GDP. However, the pitfall with this choice is that the effects of the
property tax reform -- the consolidation of land census and land registry data, the operationalization of the
cadaster, and the reduction in property registration fees -- will take time to show up in the property tax revenues
numbers. The ICR suggests that the program could have used an intermediate-results-type indicator -- “the
number of properties identified, registered, and valued over the total [number of] properties listed in the fiscal
census” -- to show progress with the property tax revenue mobilization effort. Relevance of RI3:
Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI4: An increase in the percentage of public procurement contracts for which the time between publication and
approval was less than 90 days would measure the impact of the issuance of the Code of Professional Ethics for
Public Procurement (PA5) and the passage of the new Procurement Law (PA6), both of which aimed to
streamline the public procurement process and facilitate budget execution. Because the legislation explicitly
prescribes the procurement time -- Law No. 2021-033, which reorganized the awarding, control, and regulation
of public contracts, also reduced the deadline for awarding contracts from 180 days to 90 days -- this results
indicator adequately measures the impact of the PA toward the achievement of the objective. Relevance of
RI4: Satisfactory (S).

RI5: An increase in the number of PPP contracts awarded, with data and information published on open data
formats consistent with the new PPP Law, would measure the impact of the passage of the new PPP Law
(PA7). The new PPP Law sets transparency principles for PPP transactions. This RI measures the impact of the
transparency reform toward the achievement of the objective to enhance fiscal management. Relevance of RI5:
Satisfactory (S).

RI6: A reduction in the deviation of actual borrowing from the ABP would provide evidence not only that the
government has adopted a MTDS for 2019-2023 (PA8) and an ABP (PA9), but that it has executed the strategy
well, with actual borrowing closely matching borrowing plan. Deviations would be easily tracked because the
government had created a Public Debt Portal disclosing all public and publicly guaranteed debt data (PA8).
The RI would adequately measure the impact of these debt management and debt transparency reforms.
Relevance of RI6: Satisfactory (S).

PDO2 - To improve financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors.

RI7: The Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo overall collection rate from the public sector (central
government agencies, local governments, and state-owned enterprises) would be adequate to measure the
impact of the cross-arrears clearance (PA10) and of large-consumer revenue protection, together with smart or
prepaid metering (PA11). A higher collection rate would signal an improvement in financial viability. Relevance
of RI7: Satisfactory (S).

RI8: The Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo cost recovery rate, defined as the ratio of revenue collected to
the cost of services provided, would be adequate to measure the impact of efforts to secure and boost revenues
for services provided including through the imposition of fees for public lighting (PA12) and the setting of
authorities and methodologies to periodically adjust tariffs (PA13). A higher cost recovery rate would indicate an
improvement in financial viability. Relevance of RI8: Satisfactory (S).

RI9: The cost of power production, in CFAF per kWh, would directly measure the impact of multiple efforts to
contain costs, including through the conclusion of a Transmission Service Agreement with the transmission
company (PA14), the adoption and implementation of the LCPDP (PA15), and the shift toward renewable
energy sources (PA16). As with a higher collection rate and a higher cost recovery rate, a lower cost of power
production would reflect an improvement in the financial viability of the electricity sector. Relevance of RI9:
Satisfactory (S).

RI10: The solar photovoltaics capacity installed, in megawatts, is adequate to measure the impact of promoting
renewable energy, both in the LCPDP and through legal reforms that strengthened the framework for renewable
energy generation. Relevance of RI10: Satisfactory (S).

RI11: The total amount billed for surface and groundwater extraction by industrial and commercial enterprises is
adequate to measure the impact of taxing large users in a manner that reflects the social and environmental cost

  of their consumption and reliance on freshwater aquifers. The relevance of RI11 is rated satisfactory, although
  additional details about actual payments (other than billings) would have made for a more robust measure.
  Relevance of RI11: Satisfactory (S).

  RI12: An increase in the number of water service connections with a 15 mm diameter would provide evidence
  that the decision to spread out the connection fee over time served to increase access to clean water services
  by poor households. The relevance of RI12 is rated satisfactory, based on the assumption that the service
  connections cited in the results indicator pertained to poor households (the target of the reform
  measure). Relevance of RI12: Satisfactory (S).

               OBJECTIVE 1
               Objective
               To enhance fiscal and debt management

               Rationale
               RI1: Total tax revenues rose from 12.4 percent of GDP in the baseline to 13.8 percent of GDP by closing,
               exceeding the target of 13.8 percent of GDP. The moderately satisfactory relevance rating of RI1, owing to
               attribution issues (see Section 4), warrants a downgrade of the achievement rating from High to Substantial.
               Achievement Rating: Substantial.

               RI2: VAT revenues rose from 5 percent of GDP in the baseline to 5.8 percent of GDP by closing, partially
               achieving the targeted increase to 6 percent of GDP. The fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-
               2022 may have been a factor in the slight under-performance -- the government temporarily restored the 10
               percent preferential VAT rate for the hospitality and catering industry, and loosened tax administration
               by suspending tax audits and introducing tax exemptions on essential products. Tax exemptions, which stood
               at 1.8 percent of GDP in 2018, rose to 3 percent of GDP in 2020. The emergency measures ended in 2022.
               Achievement Rating: Substantial.

               RI3: Property tax revenues remained unchanged at 0.1 percent of GDP at closing, as in the baseline, failing
               to achieve the target increase to 0.2 percent of GDP. The ICR cites two key reasons for the shortfall: (a) the
               property tax rate for built-up properties was reduced from 15 percent to 7.5 percent of net cadastral income in
               2020 to ease the financial burden on taxpayers; and (b) the GDP was rebased, impacting the capacity to
               achieve the result. The ICR also offers two positive views: (a) when the numbers are stated in three decimal
               places, property tax revenues actually increased from 0.057 percent of GDP in the baseline to 0.1 percent of
               GDP by closing, albeit still below the target 0.2 percent of GDP; and (b) the number of identified and
               registered land properties increased from 21,955 in 2019 to over 96,649 in 2022, comprising 33 percent of
               identified land in 2018. Because the target was not met, the achievement of RI3 is rated negligible (the

                                                                                                                Page 16 of 25

results indicator is also rated moderately satisfactory, owing to attribution issues (see Section 4), which would
have merited a downgrade to the achievement rating if it were other than negligible). Achievement Rating:
Negligible.

RI4: The percentage of public procurement contracts for which time between publication and approval
was less than 90 days was 13.6 percent of all contracts by closing, partially achieving the target increase
to 80 percent. A post-closing data update lifts the result slightly higher to 19.4 percent in end-2023, still
substantially below the target 80 percent. The ICR cites lagging work on the institutional capacity building to
be a principal reason for the low performance. Achievement Rating: Negligible.

RI5: The percentage of PPP contracts awarded, with data and information published on open data formats
consistent with the new PPP Law, remained unchanged at 0 percent by closing, as in the baseline, failing to
achieve the target increase to 90 percent. Togo did not award any PPP contract during the period 2019-2023.
Achievement Rating: Negligible.

RI6: The deviation of actual borrowing from the ABP was reduced from 10 percent in the baseline to 1.2
percent by closing, exceeding the target to maintain the deviation at 10 percent. Togo improved
debt management and debt transparency, leading to a reduced risk perception of Togo in the debt
markets and to lower cost of debt -- the total debt-weighted average interest rate fell from 4.51 in 2019 to 4.15
percent in 2022. The deviation of actual borrowing from the planned borrowing, as listed in ABP, exceeded
the target in all debt categories in 2022 -- 1.2 percent for total debt, 2.3 percent for internal debt, and -4.5
percent for external debt. Achievement Rating: High.

Objective
To improve financial viability and service delivery in the energy and water sectors.

Rationale
RI7: The Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo's bill collection rate from the public sector (the central
government, local governments, and state-owned enterprises) initially improved from 72 percent in the
baseline to 96.9 percent in 2019 and 98.5 percent in in 2020 before falling to 77.8 percent by closing, only
partially achieving the target increase to 95 percent. After the initial progress, the Ministry of Finance
suspended the centralization of bill collection from public agencies starting in January 2022. Thereafter, many
public entities including hospitals, the largest consumers, started accumulating arrears anew. Achievement
Rating: Negligible.

RI8: The Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo's cost recovery ratio (the ratio of revenue collected to the
cost of services provided) rose from 80 percent in the baseline to 86 percent by closing, only partially
achieving the target of 95 percent. Progress depended on several measures, including the revenue protection
program for large customers, payments for public lighting, and the use of low-cost energy sources. The

                  implementation of these reforms helped lift the ratio to 86 percent. However, these were insufficient to attain
                  the target. Tariff reform, the most significant measure with the most sizable impact, was delayed. In 2021, the
                  Government authorized the regulatory authority to set the methodology to determine the revenues
                  necessary for the Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo to achieve financial viability. However, the study to
                  determine tariff adjustments was not completed, leaving the tariff unchanged since 2010, despite rising fuel
                  acquisition costs and persistent technical losses. Achievement Rating: Modest.

                  RI9: The cost of the power production initially declined from CFAF75.4 per kWH in the baseline in 2018 to
                  CFAF67.3 per kWh in 2021 on the strength of efforts to boost local production under the LCPDP before rising
                  to CFAF78.2 per kWh in 2022, failing to achieve the target of CFAF70 per kWh. Togo built the 65-megawatt
                  (MW) gas-fired Kékéli Power Plant in 2021, commissioned the 50 MW AMEA Solar Power Plant in the same
                  year, and shifted power sourcing at the ContourGlobal Togo Power Plant to natural gas. However, as diesel
                  and natural gas prices rose (diesel and natural gas accounted for 40 percent of the energy mix), (55 percent
                  of fuel imports were denominated in U.S. dollars and the country lacked the instruments to hedge
                  against currency risk), the cost of power production accelerated to CFAF78.2 per kWh in 2022. Achievement
                  Rating: Negligible.

                  RI10: Solar photovoltaic installed capacity reached 57 MW by closing, exceeding the target of 50 MW. While
                  accounting for less than 5 percent of the energy mix, the 57 MW installed capacity was a significant
                  achievement, considering that it stood at zero MW in the baseline. Achievement Rating: High.

                  RI11: The total billed amount for groundwater and surface water extraction fees from commercial and
                  industrial enterprises rose from CFAF3.4 million in the baseline to CFAF350 million by closing, exceeding the
                  target of CFAF75 million. By charging large commercial and industrial consumers a higher rate for surface
                  and groundwater extraction, the Togolaise des Eaux improved water resource management. The levies
                  topped CFAF2.3 billion in 2022, above the target of CFAF 390 million, and accounted for 11 percent
                  of revenues in the year (the water utility has not received government subsidies since). Achievement Rating
                  High.

                  RI12: The number of connections with a 15 mm diameter rose from 91,055 in the baseline to 145,703 by
                  closing, exceeding the target of 143,254. The option offered by the Togolaise des Eaux for customers to pay
                  network connection costs (about CFAF100,000) in equal installments over three years (of CFAF25,000 each,
                  after an initial deposit of CFAF25,000) -- helped increase the number of connections to the water utility and
                  expand the access by the most vulnerable groups to clean water services. The prohibitive cost of connecting
                  to the network was a major obstacle for many households to access the distribution network of the water
                  company. Achievement Rating: High.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The risks to the sustainability of the development outcomes achieved by this project are substantial.

Togo has made progress with tax revenue mobilization, PIM, and debt sustainability, both under this
programmatic series and under its ECF arrangement with the IMF, yet the challenges remain daunting moving
forward.

      The pervasive informality in the economy is a structural constraint to boosting tax revenue mobilization
       over the long run.
      The public investment budget execution rate improved from 70 percent of GDP in 2019 to an average 82
       percent in 2020-2023, partly helped by PIM reforms supported by this series. Further progress will be at
       risk from gaps in institutional frameworks, economic integration, and political cohesion, according to an
       IMF analysis of common policies in the WAEMU countries.
      Togo is still exploring PPP opportunities (no awards were made during the period covered by this series).
       Structural reforms, including continued efforts to enhance the business environment, will remain as vital
       to attracting private investment as continuing fiscal consolidation will be to sustaining economic growth.
       Any degradation of the business environment will pose a risk to PPP activities.

      Togo First DPF 2019 (P169867)



Although access to electricity services and to clean water services has improved with the reform measures
supported by this series, the financial condition and performance of the electricity and water utilities remain
vulnerable.

      The financial balance in the electricity sector remains unstable: (a) the Compagnie Energie Electrique du
       Togo still suffers from significant commercial inefficiencies -- 77.8 percent collection rate from the public
       sector (versus a target 95 percent), 86 percent cost recovery (versus a target 95 percent); (b) the firm's
       operational inefficiencies are a drag on its finances, constraining its ability to finance new investment;
       and, (c) the firm's net result remains negative, albeit less so than in 2018.

The financial viability of the Société Togolaise des Eaux is not guaranteed, according to the ICR: (a) the rate of
water loss and leakage remains elevated, deteriorating from 30 percent in 2019 to 35 percent in 2022, because
of the degradation of non-replaced infrastructure; (b) the coverage of operating and maintenance costs dropped
from 96.7 percent in 2019 to 90.2 percent in 2022; and (c) more crucially, the availability of water resources
remains constrained




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Analytic Underpinning. The PAs were informed by diagnostic and analytical work produced by the WBG,
other development partners, the government, state-owned enterprises, and consultants, the principal findings,
and recommendations of which included the following:

      PA1, PA2, and PA3: (a) World Bank, 2019, Togo Tax Policy Study -- property taxes accounted for a
       miniscule 0.2 percent of total tax revenues in 2018, well below the average in Sub Saharan Africa
       (2019); the elimination of inefficient tax expenditure was essential to tax revenue mobilization; (b) IMF,
       2020, Staff Report - Togo Sixth Review under the Extended Credit Facility and Request
       for Augmentation of Access -- to further broaden the tax base, Togo would need to increase the level and
       permanency of revenues, asses and contain tax expenditures, and append the tax expenditures to the
       budget law.
      PA4, PA5, PA6, and PA7: (a) World Bank, 2016, Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability and
       Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review -- the procurement system in Togo
       was inefficient, marked by unusually long delays in the procurement processes, and with a large share of
       public contracts awarded on a sole source basis; though the pre-financing of projects had been
       abolished, some 36 percent of contracts were still direct contracts in 2017, with little to no information
       about public contract awards; (b) IMF, 2016, Public Investment Management Assessment -- the
       efficiency and impact of public investments was limited by a lack of transparency and delays in
       the procurement process; the late awarding of public contracts led to significant delays in implementation
       of public investment; (c) World Bank, 2018, Procuring Infrastructure PPP in Togo -- PPPs were seldom
       used to finance infrastructure projects; the governance system for PPPs was poor, with no separation of
       functions among agencies, and lacking an oversight body and a dedicated PPP agency; there was no
       disclosure of PPP contract awards information; and (d) World Bank, 2021, Togo Public Expenditure

      Review -- public procurement could be improved by the use of the application texts contained in the
      Public Procurement Law and the Public Procurement Code, the expanded use of
      electronic procurement, improvements to statistical data collection; the professionalization of
      the procurement function, and collaboration with the private sector and civil society
     PA8, PA9: (a) IMF and World Bank, 2018, G20 Note on Strengthening Public Debt Transparency -- debt
      transparency was critical to ensuring effective risk assessment and sustainable borrowing and lending
      practices; (b) World Bank, 2018, Togo Country Policy and Institutional Assessment -- the average quality
      of debt management policy and institutions in Togo was lower than among the country's IDA peers in
      Sub-Saharan Africa; and (c) World Bank, 2020, Technical Assistance Report on the Medium Term Debt
      Strategy (MTDS) and the ABP -- a comprehensive ABP was essential to the success and effectiveness
      of the MTDS.

Link to Related World Bank Operations. The series and related WBG operations in the country would benefit
from complementarities.

     The Togo Economic Governance Project, which aimed to improve PIM, DRM and public accountability,
      and monitoring mechanisms for better service delivery in priority sectors, would help build capacity at the
      Office Togolais des Recettes, implement an electronic tax filing and documentation system, and conduct
      a survey of taxpayer services.
     processes, and institutions and improve debt transparency in eligible countries, would provide TA to
      upgrade technical capacity at the Direction de la Dette Publique et du Financement.
     The Togo Energy Sector Support and Investment Project, which aimed to improve the operational
      performance of the power sector and increase access to electricity in the capital city, Lomé, would help
      determine the tariff structure and the level of social support to customers necessary to strengthen the
      operational performance and financial viability of the energy utility in the long-term.
     Togo Urban Water Security Project aimed to increase the access to, and the quality of, water supply and
      sanitation services, and to improve the operational performance of the water supply services provider(s)
      and water resources management in Greater Lomé.

     Operational Risks and Mitigation Measures. The World Bank assessed the risks to the implementation
      of the program to be substantial, overall and in many risk categories.

     Macroeconomic risk was considered substantial, arising from fiscal vulnerability and financial weakness.
      A three-year arrangement under the ECF with the IMF -- approved in 2017 for SDR176.16 million
      (US$244.8 million equivalent) -- would help mitigate macroeconomic risk. The IMF program aimed to
      reduce the overall fiscal deficit to ensure long-term debt and external sustainability (see Section 3.B),

                                                                                                    Page 21 of 25

       refocus policies on inclusive growth through targeted social spending and sustainably financed
       infrastructure spending; and resolve the financial weaknesses in the two public banks.
      Sector policy and strategy risk was rated substantial. Ongoing World Bank investment operations and
       World Bank-managed multi-donor trust funds would address this risk by helping implement the reforms
       supported by this series -- the Togo Economic Governance, with procurement reform, and the Debt
       Management Facility, with debt management (see Section 3.B).
      Institutional capacity risk was assessed as substantial at appraisal. The implementation of four
       development policy operations (DPOs) over the duration of this series would help build up administrative
       capacity in Togo and help mitigate this risk. The World Bank recommended that the government
       establish a Permanent Secretariat to oversee the implementation of reforms across sectors and ensure
       inter-ministerial collaboration and coordination. The World Bank also extended extensive TA to the
       government for institutional capacity building.
      Fiduciary risk was considered substantial. To address this risk, the Togo Economic Governance Project
       and an IMF TA engagement would help strengthen budget, disbursement, accounting, and financial
       control skills in government agencies.

      Shortcomings at Entry. The World Bank did not consider price volatility (of fuel prices and of exchange
       rates) to be a substantial risk to the implementation of this series and to the achievement of one of its
       results targets (see Section 5 - Objective 2).



Rating

Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Implementation. The World Bank supported implementation and conducted supervision adequately.

      An experienced team of headquarters and field staff was key to effective World Bank oversight of the
       program, according to the ICR.
      The World Bank encouraged the Government's Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Reform
       Policies and Financial Programs to systematically collect monitoring and evaluation data, helping with
       supervision.

Adaptation. In the augmentation of the first with a second operation, the World Bank made needed adjustments
to the reform program to maintain its relevance to pressing development problems faced by Togo during the
period, including concerns raised by the COVID-19 pandemic about the availability of clean water amid a health
crisis.

      The World Bank expanded the second program pillar, Strengthening Energy Sector Financial Viability
       and the Use of Renewable Energy, to include reforms in the water sector, Improving Financial Viability
       and Service Delivery in the Energy and Water Sectors -- poor access to infrastructure services was even

       more acute in water services (18.3 percent of the population had access to clean water in 2019) than in
       electricity services (52.5 percent had access to electricity in the same year).
      The World Bank refined the results framework to better measure the impact of reforms supported by this
       series. The World Bank added VAT revenues, as a percentage of GDP, and property tax revenues, as a
       percentage of GDP, to better reflect the results of VAT and property tax reforms measures. The World
       Bank also defined a new indicator -- the percentage of public procurement contracts for which the time
       between publication and approval is less than 90 days -- to measure the impact of the passage of a new
       Public Procurement Law, replacing the original indicator -- the percentage of officials involved in public
       procurement who have filed financial disclosure forms.
      The World Bank carefully formulated PAs for the second operation that would advance progress made
       under the first operation and strengthen prospects for achieving the reform objectives, replacing at least
       four triggers defined at the first operation (PD for the Second DPF, para 4.2.1).

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR did not present any evidence to confirm the positive social and poverty impacts expected of this
programmatic series at appraisal. Rather, the ICR reiterated the anticipated beneficial effects: (a) tax
expenditure reform will have positive indirect welfare effects; (b) property tax increases, falling mostly on the
rich, will help reduce inequality; (c) public investment reform will similarly have positive indirect welfare effects;
(d) improvements to the finances of the water utility will upgrade the firm's ability to expand access to
the underserved segments of its concession; (e) improved access to water services will benefit vulnerable
groups, including the elderly, children, and women (who are principally responsible for water-consuming
household chores).

b. Environmental

The ICR asserted that the reforms supported by this programmatic series did not have any negative impact on
the environment, forests, or other natural resources, but rather had some beneficial effects: (a) the preparation
of projects for the LCPDP produced useful environmental (land use impact) and social (stakeholder) studies; (b)
the Public Procurement Law and the PPP Law contained provisions to strengthen the environmental screening
of public projects; and (c) the taxation of surface water and groundwater extraction encouraged the prudent use
of scarce water resources.

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR is consistent with OPCS guidelines on ICRs for development financing operations and includes
sections on the relevance of PAs and the relevance of RIs. The account of the project’s performance is well
informed and concisely presented. The efficacy assessment is outcome-oriented and based on the degree of
achievement of the results targets. Explanations for the failure to achieve some results targets are highly
informative. The ICR presents ample evidence to support its assessment of the World Bank’s performance at
design and during implementation. The record of the analytic underpinnings of the operation, the connection with
other World Bank operations in Togo, and the implementation risks that were apparent at appraisal are detailed.
The ICR draws lessons that would be valuable to DPOs focused on reforms in public investment and in the
utilities sectors.

12. Lessons

Three lessons are drawn from the ICR, with some adaptation.

DPOs should allow implementing agencies sufficient time to build up their institutional capacity to
execute structural reforms. This series set the time to achieve the procurement result (the reduction in
procurement time to under 90 days) to six months from the enactment of the new Public Procurement Law. In
the context of weak administrative capacity throughout the bureaucracy, the time was insufficient for government
agencies to reform their procurement practices following the new law. The target that 80 percent of all
procurement contracts conform to the new law within six months was extremely ambitious and unrealistic.

Exogenous shocks should be considered as risks to the successful implementation of a reform
program. This series did not consider fuel price fluctuations and exchange rate fluctuations as risks to achieving
the target to lower the cost of energy production in local currency terms. The rise in imported fuel prices and the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar made fuel prices more costly, raising rather than lowering the cost of energy
production.

Improving operational efficiency and strengthening governance are crucial to achieving financial
viability and sustainability at utilities. In this series, technical and non-technical losses remained high, at
around 16 percent, jeopardizing the financial soundness of the Compagnie Energy Electrique du
Togo. Governance also remained weak, with management unsuccessful in controlling personnel costs, which
exceeded 26 percent of total costs, or to institute performance contracts.
