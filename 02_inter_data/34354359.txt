d. Components
   The Public Financial Management Improvement Project (PFMIP) had four main components:

   Component 1: Improving Budget Expenditure Management and Control (Appraisal: US$1.07 million;
   Actual: US$1.29 million)

   This component aimed to address core weaknesses in expenditure management and control through four
   sub-components:

         Subcomponent 1.1: Improving Budget Expenditure Management, Financial Control and Cash
          Planning: This subcomponent aimed to design and implement a commitment control system (CCS),
          modernize financial controls, and operationalize annual cash planning. The activities included
          upgrading the existing pilot-based single commitment system to a proper CCS, operationalizing the
          annual cash planning held by the Accountant General at the Ministry of Finance and Planning
          (MoFP), setting up an ad hoc committee to determine quarterly budget allotments, and modernizing
          financial control in line with the new CCS and international standards.
         Subcomponent 1.2: Establishing Medical E-Referrals System Linkages with CCS: This sub-
          component aimed to develop an information exchange between the e-referral system at the Ministry
          of Health and the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) at the MoFP to
          better manage health referral expenditures.
         Subcomponent 1.3: Enhancing MoFP Management of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers: The
          subcomponent aimed to build MoFP capacity to improve procedures, forecasts, and fiscal discipline
          related to intergovernmental transfers.
         Subcomponent 1.4: Enhancing Wage Bill Establishment Control: The subcomponent targeted
          developing tools to oversee the wage bill and link the human resource Information Technology (IT)
          system with the payroll system.

   Component 2: Improving Financial Accountability of the Public Financial Management (PFM)
   System (Appraisal: US$1.00 million, Actual: US$0.72 million)

   This component focused on addressing weaknesses in financial accountability through four
   subcomponents:

   Subcomponent 2.1: Aligning Accounting/Reporting with International Standards: This subcomponent
   supported the implementation of cash-basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and

                                                                                                Page 2 of 20

  Government Finance Statistics (GFS)-aligned reporting. The main activities included issuing and
  implementing Accountant General’s instruction in the area of mandatory cash IPSAS policies, preparation of
  financial statements and reports aligned with GFS standard.

        Subcomponent 2.2: Improving Bank Reconciliation: The subcomponent aimed to re-engineer
         processes and automate bank reconciliation.
        Subcomponent 2.3: Reducing Backlog of Financial Statements: The subcomponent aimed to reduce
         backlog, catch-up on delayed financial statements from 2013 onwards, and publish them.
        Subcomponent 2.4: Enhancing State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) Capacity to
         Audit Bank Projects: Piloted World Bank project audits by the state audit institution SAACB to build
         auditing capacity.

  Component 3: Modernizing Public Procurement (Appraisal: US$0.80 million, Actual: US$0.92 million)

  This component aimed to implement aspects of the 2014 procurement law reforms through:

        Subcomponent 3.1: Institutional Strengthening of the High Council for Public Procurement Policies
         (HCPPP): The sub-component supported the development of internal systems and procedures for
         the HCPPP Secretariat, building capacity of HCPPP staff, establishing an independent Dispute
         Review Unit (DRU), and developing and implementing a performance monitoring framework for the
         HCPPP.
        Subcomponent 3.2: Development of Modern Procurement Tools: supported the development and
         implementation of the Single Procurement Portal (SPP), developing framework agreements for
         procurement of common-use goods and services, and issuing sector-specific Standards Bidding
         Documents (SBDs).
        Subcomponent 3.3: Capacity Building of the Procurement Workforce. The sub-component supported
         the development and delivery of a sustainable training program to 300 procurement officials.

  Component 4: Project Implementation Support and Management Costs (Appraisal: US$0.63 million,
  Actual: US$0.56 million)

  This component financed the Project Management Unit's (PMU) functions in managing project
  implementation, coordination, monitoring and evaluation.

  Restructuring:

  Restructuring No.1: March 10, 2022. The project underwent a Level-2 restructuring to extend the closing
  date by one year from June 30, 2022, to June 30, 2023, to allow for the completion of the procurement of
  the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS), which was delayed due to lengthy
  contracting procedures with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), (ICR,
  p11). The project objectives and outcome targets were not revised.

   At appraisal, the Project’s original cost was US$3.50 million from The Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank
   (TFGWB) with co-financing from the Public Financial Management Improvement Project Multi Donor Trust
   Fund (PFMIP MDTF).

   The actual disbursed at closing was US$3.49 million.

   The allocations within components slightly deviated from appraised amount, however, it remained within the
   overall appraisal amount.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
At appraisal, economic growth had slowed, the economy was fragile, and large structural fiscal deficits
persisted. GDP growth contracted from 5 percent in 2016 to 3.1 percent in 2017 and was estimated to be
stagnant in per capita terms (PAD p. 7). Unemployment rates were high, averaging 27 percent, and as
high as 44 percent in Gaza. The PA relied heavily on donor aid, which had been declining and monthly
clearance revenues which were also volatile and unpredictable (PAD p. 7). While fiscal deficit had declined
from 24.6 percent in 2008 to 7.7 percent in 2017, the PA continued to depend heavily on donor grants. A
substantial financing gap persisted, which contributed to an accumulation of arrears to the private sector.
The unpredictable nature of the flow of revenues collected on behalf of the PA by the Israeli authorities, and
the decline of donor aid particularly from the GCC countries create additional constraints, (PAD p.19).This
was further complicated by a complex monthly revenue clearance process and transfers of revenues
collected monthly to the PA, known as the monthly clearance revenues. However, these transfers had been
volatile and are subject to deductions for electricity and water supply arrears, plus a penalty for late
payment, which complicated in-year cash management operations.

At appraisal, Public Financial Management (PFM) systems operated at satisfactorily basic levels, but
reforms were fragmented. The PFM system was strained by the accumulation of arrears due to a large
financing gap and limited ability to raise financing in an optimal manner, which manifested in weak budget
execution (ICR p. 5). Constraints on the PFM system included: (a) accumulation of expenditure arrears due
to weak cash commitment controls and unpredictable inflows with arrears to the private sector and across
government levels (e.g., in health referrals) undermining service delivery and private sector confidence; (b)
weak budget credibility and fiscal discipline due to factors like over-commitments, unrealistic revenue
projections, and lack of alignment between procurement plans and available resources; (c) gaps in financial
accountability, with a backlog of financial statements, lack of adherence to international accounting and
reporting standards, and capacity constraints in external audit; (d) incomplete implementation of the 2014
procurement reforms, limiting competition, transparency, and efficiency in public procurement. These PFM
challenges had cross-cutting impacts on government operations, service delivery and the private sector.
They contributed to the accumulation of arrears, undermined strategic prioritization of resources, and
eroded trust in public finances.

The World Bank Assistance Strategies (AS) further underscore the importance of strong PFM for the
PA. The FY18-21 AS highlighted the need to strengthen public institutions for improved citizen-centered
service delivery. It emphasized enhancing public resource management and fiscal stability as key
prerequisites. The FY22-25 AS further reiterated PFM strengthening as critical for effective and accountable

               government operations and for creating an enabling environment for private sector development. This
               project sought to address several PFM reform priorities identified in the two AS, such as improving fiscal
               discipline through expenditure controls and cash management, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness
               of public spending through modernizing PFM systems and processes, and strengthening accountability and
               transparency through timely financial reporting and auditing.

               In this context, the project's objectives demonstrate high relevance by directly targeting the basic
               PFM bottlenecks:

                                       PDO1: 'Enhancing expenditure control’ aimed to partially address important causes of arrears and
                                        commitment controls, cash management and oversight of key spending areas.
                                       PDO2: ‘Enhancing financial accountability of the PA’ aimed to clear the backlog of financial
                                        statements, align accounting and reporting with international standards, and strengthen external
                                        audit capacity.
                                       PDO3: 'Enhancing procurement management of the PA’ aimed to operationalize key aspects of the
                                        2014 procurement law to improve competition, transparency, and efficiency in public procurement.

               The objectives were highly relevant in addressing PFM constraints. The project took a phased
               approach focusing on basic reforms before addressing more ambitious objectives of building trust in public
               institutions through improvement in the fiscal environment, financial reporting, and procurement. It targeted
               a relevant set of issues in budget execution, accountability, and procurement that were critical to
               strengthening the PA and was appropriately pitched to the territory's capacity.

               The project objectives were relevant to the sectoral and local context. They addressed binding PFM
               constraints that impacted fiscal stability, service delivery and private sector development - which were
               central priorities in WB's ASs of 2017-2021 and 2022-2025. The objectives were also well-calibrated to the
               PA's capacity and aligned with the PA’s policy agenda and PFM strategy.

                             To enhance expenditure controls of the PA

                             Rationale
                             Theory of Change (ToC): The project aimed to enhance expenditure controls by upgrading the CCS,
                             improving cash planning, and modernizing financial controls. These outputs were expected to lead to better
                             alignment of expenditure commitments with available resources and cash flows. This, in turn, was intended to

result in enhanced overall expenditure control and "reduce the risk of further arrears”, (ICR p. 35). . The ToC
thus posited that strengthening key PFM systems and processes related to commitment recording, cash
management, and financial controls would enable better fiscal discipline and expenditure management.

Key Outputs:

        CCS implemented in 13 line ministries, but for only one cost center (salaries)
        Financial control manual developed
        Cash management committee established; but cash planning procedures not fully operationalized
        Medical e-referral system linked with IFMIS
        Payroll and HR systems interconnected

Intermediate indicators and outcomes:

IRI1: A Commitment Control System (CCS) is established in line ministries: The CCS was expected to
enable MoF to identify, report, and control commitments against allocations and outstanding commitments at
the early incurrence stage of the expenditure. At project closure, the following had been achieved: i)
development of the CCS module in consultation with key stakeholders, ii) introduction of system modifications
to integrate CCS in IFMIS/Bisan, iii) development of a procedural manual for the CCS, and iv) establishment
of a cash committee (2021) at MOF to help determine the quarterly budget allotments to ministries based on
the new and outstanding commitments and cash forecasts, (ICR p. 14). By June 2023, the CCS had been
rolled out in 13 ministries but only for operating expenditures, partially meeting the target, given it did not
cover all types of costs. Partially Achieved.

IRI2: The role of the Financial Controllers (FC) is amended in line with the new proposed CCS and
good international practices: Development of a financial control manual was completed. The manual
documented the existing general legal framework for financial control, integrating the FC’s procedures with
IFMIS procedure-based support and streamlined the control modalities in line with the new international
standards. Alignment of role of FC with the CCS and international best practices was successfully met, with a
detailed manual and training provided but full adoption of the new control modalities remained largely
incomplete at project closure (ICR p. 15). Achieved.

IRI3: The Payroll and HR systems (MoFP and GPC respectively) are interconnect: The project was
expected to support MoF in developing an adequate back-office monitoring and control budgetary tool.
While the payroll system was financed by the European Union, the technical specifications and design was
supported by the Project, through financing of experts. Integration of the HR IT and the Payroll systems was
expected to support the implementation of wage bill policies through the use of wage bill budgetary control
procedures. At project closure however, the payroll system was not operationalized, but was still in the testing
stage, and the back-office monitoring and control budgetary tools had not been implemented. Not achieved.

IRI4: E-Referrals (MoH) and IFMIS (MoFP) are interconnected for exchange of data: The project
supported PA in integrating the MOH’s service purchase module (E-Referral module) with IFMIS/Bisan to
allow the exchange of data between the two systems to enhance the management of health e-referral
expenditure (ICR p. 15). Service providers (hospitals), financial department at MoH, and service purchase
department at MoH were electronically linked to the IFMIS/Bisan at MoF. The project financed hardware and
software (including APIs) and targeted training for the MOH Special Purchasing Unit (SPU). Interconnectivity
of the two systems facilitated monitoring, by the MoH of the trends of the health referral expenditure against

Outcomes

PDO indicator 1: Improved process for budget allotments established that increases predictability to
line ministries based on cash forecasts: Partial roll-out in 13 ministries out of 23, enabled the
establishment of a link between budget, expenditure, and cash availability but the risk of arrears remained.
While and an ad hoc committee was established, the meetings were irregular. Partially Achieved.

PDO indicator 2: Reduction in the gap between budgeted and actual expenditure on referrals to less
than 10%: There was some variation between 2020 and 2021, as the budget fluctuated. In 2020, the gap
was less than 10%, with a budget of 850 million shekels. In 2021, the budget was reduced to 700
million shekels, and the gap exceeded 10%. In 2022, the 10% threshold was also exceeded. By the end of
the project, the ad hoc committee had not been established. Not Achieved.

Efficacy Rating: Objective 1 focusing on improving budget expenditure management and control, included
two PDO indicators and four Intermediate Results Indicators (IRIs). The IRIs for PDO 1 suggest the project
made partial progress, with the CCS, financial control manual, and IFMIS-referral system link as key
achievements. IRI2 and IRI4 were achieved and IRI1 was partially achieved. However, gaps remained in the
coverage and functionality of these PFM tools. The volatile fiscal context also posed challenges beyond the
project's direct control. PDO1 was partially achieved. Modest

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To enhance financial accountability of the PA

Rationale
Theory of Change: The project sought to enhance financial accountability through a range of interventions:
(a) aligning accounting and reporting with international standards; (b) improving bank reconciliation; (c)
clearing the backlog of financial statements; and (d) enhancing the capacity of the SAACB. These outputs
were expected to lead to more timely, credible, and transparent financial information and enhanced overall
financial accountability of the PA to key stakeholders.

Key Outputs:

        2014 to 2021 financial statements cleared and published as per international standards
        Bank reconciliation automated through IFMIS and coverage expanded
        SAACB's capacity built to conduct audits of World Bank-financed projects
        Training provided to 217 staff on Public Sector Accounting Standards and financial reporting

Intermediate indicators and outcomes:

IRI5: MOFP publicly disseminates audited financial statements and holds an event to engage the
public: The project supported issuing all audited financial statements outstanding since 2014. To achieve
this, the project assisted the MoF in overcoming several technical hurdles, including trial balance manual
compilation, manual bank reconciliation, and consolidation of financial statements. The audited financial
statements were disseminated through a public event for different stakeholders including CSOs, media, and
academia. In addition to issuing the backlog of financial statements, the annual financial statements were
published, providing access to financial information to the citizens interested in the performance of the PA. To
institutionalize the process, the project established clear procedures for preparing the annual financial
statements and ensured the knowledge was transferred to the MoF team (ICR p. 16). Achieved.

had been issued and published. In addition, the 2021 audited financial statements had been published by
June 2023. Achieved.

Efficacy Rating: PDO2 was measured by one PDO indicator and one IRI, both achieved one year later than
originally planned. The project made significant strides in improving financial accountability with the clearance
and publication of financial statements. SAACB's enhanced capacity and the progress in bank reconciliation
also contributed to the objective. High

OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
To enhance procurement management of the PA.

Rationale
Theory of Change: Under this PDO the project aimed to enhance the management of public procurement by
strengthening the institutional capacity of the High Council for Public Procurement Policies (HCPPP), rolling
out an e-procurement system, and building the capacity of the procurement workforce. These outputs were
intended to lead to improved functionality, transparency, and capacity of the procurement system as an
intermediate outcome. This, in turn, was expected to result in enhanced efficiency, transparency and
compliance in public procurement as the final development outcome. The underlying theory of change was

that investing in the institutional structures, systems and human resources related to procurement would lead
to a better-functioning and more accountable procurement regime.

Key Outputs:

      HCPPP's institutional and HR capacity significantly strengthened
      Procurement portal enhanced and rolled out to all central government entities and 100% of
       municipalities
      Standard bidding documents developed and adopted
      419 staff trained on various procurement aspects
      Complaints review mechanism operationalized

Intermediate Indicators and Outcomes:

IRI6: A Dispute Review Unit (DRU) responsible for administrative review of appeals from aggrieved
bidders, established in accordance with the Public Procurement Law (PPL): The project supported
many activities related to the establishment and functioning of the DRU. The project supported the
establishment of the DRU, and making the DRU operational, with a list of experts established by HCPPP and
four permanent members appointed by the Cabinet. The DRU is responsible for reviewing appeals from
aggrieved bidders concerning alleged non-compliance by procuring entities in conducting procurement
proceedings. Hence, the project contributed to building the institutional capacity of the HCPPP by mobilizing
local experts to work alongside HCPPP staff on operationalizing its key functions and providing targeted
training and knowledge transfer to the HCPPP staff. Throughout the project, 17 appeals were received,
resolved, and the decisions were published on the Single Procurement Portal (SPP). A 3-year communication
strategy was also developed for HCPPP with an action plan to help promote general awareness of the
innovations and benefits of the new procurement law, clarifying HCPPP mandates and responsibilities, and
emphasizing the use of the single public procurement portal among the public procurement entities, the
Palestinian private sector, and other stakeholders. Achieved.

                            PDO indicator 4: Public procuring entities disclose their procurement plans, procurement notices,
                            and contract awards on the single portal procurement web: At the end of the project, 100% of procuring
                            entities at both the central and municipal levels were utilizing the SPP. Achieved.

                            Efficacy Rating: PDO3 was measured by one PDO indicator and one IRI, which were both achieved. The
                            wide roll-out of the e-procurement system, development of HCPPP's capacity and complaints mechanism,
                            and extensive training of the procurement cadre represent major progress. While comprehensive reports
                            could not be generated from the SPP system due to incomplete data on procurement transactions, the annual
                            reports to the Cabinet were prepared using a combination of system generated and manual reports (ICR,
                            p47). Despite these shortcomings, , the project substantially achieved the key intended outcomes in this area.

                            Rationale
                            The overall efficacy is rated Substantial, considering the substantial relevance of the objectives and the
                            substantial achievement of the majority of the PDO outcomes. Of the four PDO indicators, two achieved their
                            targets (PDO indicators 3 and 4), one partially achieved (PDO indicator 1) and one was not achieved (PDO
                            indicator 2). Of the seven IRIs, five were achieved (IRI6, IRI5, IRI4, IRI2), one was partially achieved (IRI1),
                            and one was not achieved (IRI3). This performance at both the PDO and intermediate levels supports an
                            overall efficacy rating of substantial, despite the shortcomings in a few specific indicators.

  The project also supported debt management enhancements; a decision made after the MTR which also
  approved an extension of the closing date. The support included: (a) revising the debt law of 1966 and 2005
  and (b) developing and installing a new debt management system. It was expected that establishing a proper
  debt management legal framework and IT solutions would improve expenditure control consistent with the
  PDO and would contribute to better debt management and expenditure control. In line with the project
  ambition, a Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS), a debt management system, was
  procured. A revised law was finalized in 2022 and at project closure was awaiting endorsement of the
  President.

 5. Efficiency
The project achieved reasonable results within the budget in a challenging environment. It disbursed
99.8% of its total budget of $3.5 million, indicating high absorption and utilization of funds. Project management
costs were reasonable at 16% of the total cost, within the original budget estimates. The project also achieved
cost savings in some activities, such as rolling out the e-procurement system at a lower than budgeted cost. It
leveraged existing IT systems, such as IFMIS, to achieve results efficiently.

A traditional economic analysis was not conducted at appraisal or closing due to the technical
assistance nature of the project. The PAD argued that a cost-benefit analysis would not yield meaningful
results for a project focused on institutional capacity building and PFM reforms (PAD, p. 21). The ICR noted that
the project's benefits, such as improved fiscal discipline, enhanced transparency and accountability, and better
value for money in public procurement, are largely intangible and difficult to quantify in monetary terms (ICR, p.
20). Nevertheless, the project's achievements in strengthening key PFM institutions and processes are expected
to generate significant economic benefits over time through more efficient and accountable use of public
resources.

While the project was completed within a reasonable timeframe and budget, the ICR lacked a robust economic
analysis to demonstrate the project's impact on key issues such as arrears, MoF, and local governments
financial position. The project does not provide a result indicator that effectively monitor progress on the
outcome of expenditure arrears (expenditure arrears as percent of total budget). Secondly, one of the
unintended outcomes of the project could be weakened local government service delivery capabilities given a
tightened cash and expenditure controls by MoF. Neither the PAD nor ICR have assessed potential trade-offs
and the unintended consequences of reforms in such a fragile setting.

The project faced some operational inefficiencies, particularly in the early years, as building consensus
among stakeholders on key reforms such as the commitment control system took longer than expected.
Coordination challenges among the multiple implementing agencies (MoF, SAACB, HCPPP) and other
stakeholders sometimes led to implementation delays. While consensus building was a necessity, a
more proactive approach to sensitizing government leadership to reforms could have helped reduce delays. The
COVID-19 pandemic in the last year also caused some disruptions. However, the project leveraged several
operational efficiencies that helped mitigate these challenges. The use of a centralized PMU in the MoF helped

                                                                                                     Page 13 of 20

ensure coordinated implementation and monitoring of activities across components. The project leveraged
existing World Bank-financed projects and structures, such as the Procurement Reform TA, to achieve
synergies and avoid duplication. The capacity building and training of trainers approach helped ensure
sustainability and continued benefits beyond the project lifetime.

Overall, the project achieved its results within the planned budget envelope, despite the challenging context.
However, stronger economic analysis at appraisal and closing, even if qualitative in nature, would have helped
provide a more robust evidence base for assessing efficiency.

Efficiency is rated Substantial based on the project's high budget utilization, reasonable administrative costs,
cost savings realized, and satisfactory operational efficiency in a challenging environment.

6. Outcome

The overall outcome rating for the project is assessed Satisfactory given a substantial rating for the three
criteria, relevance, efficacy and efficiency, The project made notable achievements in key areas of PFM in a
challenging and fragile context. The project’s objectives were highly relevant given the focus on expenditure
controls, financial accountability and procurement management which addressed key weaknesses in PFM
systems. The project was completed within the planned budget despite a one-time extension. While the project
made notable progress under PDO 2 and PDO 3, it fell short in realizing its core objective under PDO 1,
representing a significant shortfall.

      GZ: PFM Improvement (P162850)



The risk to development outcome is significant given the fragile and volatile context in which the
project was implemented. Political instability and governance challenges pose a substantial risk to the
sustainability of the project's achievements. The West Bank and Gaza have a history of conflict, political
tensions, and weak governance institutions, which could undermine the continued implementation and
enforcement of the PFM reforms supported by this project. Changes in political priorities or leadership could
lead to a reversal or weakening of the commitment to maintaining and building upon the project
outcomes. At project appraisal, the overall governance risk and overall risk rating was considered
challenging and substantial. Capacity constraints limited the PA’s ability to undertake substantive reforms,
(PAD p. 19). The high risk inherent to the political and governance situation was highlighted, with the
proposal for close monitoring as a mitigation measure (PAD p. 19).

The fragile economic situation and fiscal constraints also present significant risks. The PA faces high
budget deficits, high levels of public debt, and a heavy reliance on external aid. These financial pressures
could hamper sustained investments in PFM systems, capacity building, and institutional strengthening that
were supported by the project. If the PA is unable to maintain adequate resources and staffing for key PFM
functions, the gains in expenditure control, financial reporting, and procurement management could be
eroded over time.

The project's achievements in enhancing transparency and accountability of public finances could
also be at risk if there is a lack of sustained political will and public demand for these reforms. In a
context of political instability and competing priorities, there may be pressures to reduce transparency or
bypass accountability mechanisms, which could undermine the long-term impact of the project.

The ICR discusses a proposed follow-up World Bank supported operation that could help sustain, and build
on, some of the gains. This operation, Public Financial Management Improvement Project Phase 2
(P177742), was approved in 2022. Risk to the project’s outcomes, however, remain high as the current
conflict negatively impacts the PA’s fiscal position. A May 2024 Economic Monitoring Report found that “the
fiscal situation of the Palestinian Authority has dramatically worsened in the last three months, significantly
raising the risk of a fiscal collapse,” due to a “drastic reduction in clearance revenue transfers” and a
“massive drop in economic activity.” This is likely to impact the project’s outcomes, especially under
Objective 1, enhancing expenditure controls.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  While the project was well-designed to achieve the PDO it did not address the root causes of the
  PA’s weak PFM. The ICR identifies those as a large financing gap and an inability to optimally raise
  financing. The unpredictability ofclearance revenues exacerbate the challenge of applying a commitment
  control system and leads to delayed payments to contractors and the accumulation of arrears. This, in
  turn, results in a discretionary cash rationing process that lacks sufficient transparency and accountability
  and affects service delivery of key sectors, including health, education, and municipalities. While political
  economy constraints cannot be addressed by the WB operation, without their resolution, PFM challenges
  will remain, regardless of the success of the WB operation. Indeed, the 2017 PEFA assessed the
  commitment control as relatively high, yet the PA fell short of cash availability due to declining grants and
  volatility of the monthly clearance revenues. It is thus unlikely that the operation will have the intended

  ‘long term impacts’ identified in the theory of change to: “enhance private sector investments, job
  creation, and fiscal stability.”

  The World Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
  project design incorporated lessons learned from previous PFM operations and technical assistance
  activities in the West Bank and Gaza. These include the need for a gradual and phased approach to PFM
  reforms, focusing on a few simple priorities, ensuring strong government ownership and leadership by
  establishing a PMU within the MoFP. The operation was well coordinated with key development partners
  including the International Monetary Fund and Department of International Development (UK), including
  for potential financing of complementary reforms/activities. Finally, the components and activities were
  generally well-structured to address the identified PFM weaknesses, and the results framework included
  measurable indicators to track progress toward the objectives.

  However, there were several shortcomings in the responsiveness of the design to the local government
  challenges and potential unintended consequences, the realism of some objectives and targets, the
  articulation of the theory of change and assumptions, and the attention to institutional sustainability
  issues in the fragile context. While the Net Lending Portal, currently being piloted with one municipality,
  could help improve transparency in intergovernmental transfers, the potential unintended consequences
  of tightened cash management on local governments' ability to deliver services were not adequately
  considered. Due to further tightening of expenditure controls and growing need for revenues at the
  central level, local government may likely receive a reduced share of revenues. This could reduce
  resources for municipal provision of services such as education, health, and sanitation. Secondly, the
  project's TOC and assumptions about how the PFM reforms would contribute to the higher-level
  objectives of improving service delivery and promoting private investment in the fragile context are not
  well articulated. Finally, a more explicit consideration of the political economy factors and institutional
  constraints that could affect the achievement and sustainability of outcomes would have strengthened the
  project design. This includes a more proactive approach to sensitizing government leadership on the
  retention of capacity developed in the government.

 the project lifecycle. The team conducted periodic supervision missions, maintained close communication
 with the PMU, and provided timely technical advice and problem-solving support to address
 implementation challenges.

 The World Bank team demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in adapting to the changing
 circumstances and needs of the project. When implementation delays occurred due to political
 instability or institutional capacity constraints, the team worked closely with the PA to identify remedial
 actions and adjust the project activities and timelines as needed. The project team met PMU and relevant
 government officials on bi-weekly basis to address any emerging issues related to implementation. The
 team remained in West Bank to support the implementation and address any unforeseen disruptions. For

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The overall M&E design has sound elements with relevant and measurable PDO and intermediate results
 indicators. The overall PDO was clear and there was a mix of quantitative and qualitative indicators to track
 progress. However, the results framework was overly focused on establishing systems, procedures, and
 manuals, without sufficient indicators to assess whether these are actually being utilized and leading to the
 desired changes in PFM practices. There was a lack of indicators to measure the higher-level, longer-term
 impacts on expenditure control, financial accountability, and procurement efficiency. The results chain
 beyond the immediate outputs and short-term outcomes was not well articulated or measured.

 The selected indicators covered the specific aspects of PFM performance, such as expenditure control,
 financial accountability, and procurement management. The M&E design could have been improved to
 measure the project’s contribution to progress on higher-level objectives of improving fiscal stability, service
 delivery and trust in public institutions. For example, the M&E framework does not measure the in-year
 budget deviations or the buildup of new arrears during a fiscal year. Similarly, qualitative indicators to
 assess issues like citizen engagement, changes in behaviors/practices, and institutional capacity building
 are missing. For example, the PDO3 indicator focused on the percentage of procurement entities using the
 portal but did not assess the actual utilization of the portal for all procurement transactions. While this
 indicator was likely set based on what was deemed achievable given the project timeframe and resources
 available to the implementing agency (HCPPP), the ambition could have been set slightly higher.



b. M&E Implementation
  The PMU within the MoFP collected, analyzed, and reported data on the project's indicators. The PMU
  regularly prepared progress reports, which were shared with the World Bank team and other
  stakeholders. The World Bank team provided regular implementation support and guidance on M&E,
  ensuring data quality and timely reporting reducing the need for more frequent and consistent official
  implementation support missions.

  However, there were a few challenges in M&E implementation: a) The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted
  some data collection and monitoring activities; b) the focus was primarily on tracking outputs and
  immediate outcomes, with less attention to assessing longer-term impacts, sustainability, and utilization.
  For instance, the PDO2 and PDO3 indicators capture a significant aspect of transparency, however, they

                                                                                                     Page 17 of 20

  did not fully reflect the extent to which these reports were being utilized for comprehensive monitoring
  and accountability.



c. M&E Utilization
  The PMU, World Bank team, and other stakeholders effectively used the M&E data and findings to
  inform project implementation and decision-making. The PMU used M&E data to monitor progress,
  identify bottlenecks, and take corrective actions. The World Bank team used M&E information to provide
  targeted implementation support and inform policy dialogue with the PA on PFM reforms.

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The ICR and project documents do not report any significant environmental or social issues during project
   implementation. The project was classified as Category C, indicating that no significant environmental or
   social impacts were anticipated. The project did not trigger any of the World Bank's safeguard policies, as it
   primarily focused on technical assistance, capacity building, and institutional strengthening activities related
   to public financial management.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   The ICR reports that the project's financial management arrangements were satisfactory throughout the
   implementation period. The PMU maintained adequate financial records, prepared timely financial reports,
   and ensured compliance with the World Bank's financial management policies and procedures. The
   project's financial statements were regularly audited by an independent auditor, and the audit reports were
   unqualified, indicating no significant issues or irregularities.

   On the procurement side, the project followed the World Bank's procurement guidelines and the
   Palestinian Authority's procurement regulations. The ICR notes that procurement activities were carried out
   efficiently and transparently, with no major issues or delays reported. The PMU maintained adequate
   procurement records and ensured compliance with the agreed procurement plan.




c. Unintended impacts (Positive or Negative)
   No positive or negative unintended impacts were documented.

12. Lessons

The ICRR concurs with the ICR’s lessons and adds the following lessons:

    1. The need for a long-term and comprehensive approach to PFM reforms. The project's
       focus on specific aspects of PFM, such as expenditure control, financial accountability, and
       procurement, was important and yielded positive results. However, the sustainability and
       impact of these reforms could be enhanced by adopting a more comprehensive and long-
       term approach that addresses the underlying institutional and governance challenges facing
       the PA. This could involve supporting broader public sector reforms, strengthening the role of
       oversight institutions, and promoting greater transparency and citizen engagement in PFM
       including of the local governments.
    2. The importance of monitoring and mitigating the unintended consequences of PFM
       reforms. While the project's focus on strengthening expenditure controls and cash
       management was important for fiscal discipline, it may have had unintended consequences
       on the flexibility and responsiveness of the budget process, particularly of local governments
       and service delivery units. Future operations should carefully monitor and mitigate any
       unintended impacts of PFM reforms and ensure that they do not undermine other important
       objectives, such as service delivery and local governance.
    3. Sustained high-level government commitment is critical for successful PFM reform
       implementation, especially when facing resistance from vested interests. The project
       experienced setbacks when a new political leadership intervened to stall the CCS
       implementation, suggesting the need for stronger political economy analysis and strategies
       to build durable commitment from key decision-makers. Relying solely on technical solutions
       is insufficient - projects should also focus on facilitating reform champions and managing
       resistance.

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR provides a comprehensive and well-structured assessment of the project's performance, covering the
relevant aspects of the project's design, implementation, and outcomes. The ICR could have better
documented the project's unintended impacts, both positive and negative, and provided more evidence to
support the claims made about the project's broader effects on public trust, private sector competition, and
public administration performance.
