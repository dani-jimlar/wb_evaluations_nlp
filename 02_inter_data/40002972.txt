2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   The development objective of the project was to: (i) support an expanded and more enhanced social safety
   nets project; and (ii) support access to basic services in targeted poor communities (Financing agreement,
   p.5).

   Note: The PAD defined an ‘enhanced’ Social Safety Net (SSN) system as improved targeting of program
   beneficiaries, an enlarged social registry, and effective accompanying measures in conjunction with
   conditional CTs.

   The objectives were revised to support: (i) an expanded and enhanced social safety nets system; (ii) access
   to basic services in targeted poor communities and (iii) rapid targeted food security safety net response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic (Amendment to Financing Agreement, p.1). A split rating will not be applied, as the
   project's scope has been expanded through the revision.

  1.1 (US$7.5 million) provided phased CT payments to 8,362 poor households, with eligibility based on
  poverty levels, young children, and community-based targeting. Sub-component 1.2 (US$1 million) funded
  behavior change sessions on early childhood development, delivered by trained volunteers (mères
  conseillères) and open to all community members, including refugees and minorities.

  Component 2: Strengthening social protection delivery systems (Appraisal: US$2.1 million,
  Actual: US$2.3 million): This component aimed to enhance the PNSF and broader social protection
  system through technical assistance and capacity building. Key efforts included expanding the national
  social registry (covering refugees), improving targeting methods (Proxy-Means Test (PMT) and community-
  based approaches), and strengthening the program's MIS for enrolment, payments, and grievance
  management. Investments focused on building Secrétariat d’Etat chargé des Affaires sociales (State
  Secretariat for Social Affairs, SEAS) capacity for implementation, outreach, M&E, grievance redress, and
  upgrading social counters for service delivery. Additionally, it included a process evaluation, an assessment
  of the PMT mechanism, and an evaluation of its performance.

  Component 3: Community-Based Investments in Basic Services (Appraisal: US$3.1 million, Actual:
  US$3.8 million): This component focused on improving human capital by investing in basic services
  infrastructure in poor or isolated regions and communities hosting refugees, aligning with Component 1's
  geographic areas. It strengthened the capacity of the Ministry of Decentralization and regional councils to
  enhance social services infrastructure, including water supply, sanitation, resource management, schools,
  markets, and rural roads. Eligible community associations received small grants to select and implement
  sub-projects. Community members, including refugees, participated in training on grassroots management,
  needs assessment, procurement, financial management, participatory planning, M&E, and maintenance.

  Component 4: Project Management (Appraisal:US$1.3 million, Actual: US$2.0 million): This
  component funded project management and coordination through SEAS, covering consultant salaries,
  project equipment, operating costs, financial management, training, workshops, learning activities,
  communications, and implementation supervision.

  Component 5: Household Food Security Response to COVID-19 (added during 2020 Additional
  financing; Appraisal: 0 million, Actual: US$4.9 million) From April to June 2020, this component
  provided 27,000 food vouchers, primarily targeting women (60% of beneficiaries) listed in the national social
  registry. Each voucher, worth DJF 10,000 (US$56), allowed households to purchase food items from
  participating retailers in Djiboutiville and Balbala.

  Component 6: Contingent Emergency Response (CERC) (added during 2020 Additional financing;
  Appraisal: 0 million, Actual: US$0.0 million): This component enabled rapid crisis response in case of a
  worsening crisis or an eligible emergency, but no funds were utilized.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  The project was approved on May 15, 2019, and became effective on November 29, 2019. A mid-term
  review was conducted on December 31, 2023, which also marked the project’s closing date. The original
  budget for the project was $30 million, which remained unchanged after revisions. The actual disbursed
  amount totaled $29,074,951.31. The project was approved on May 15, 2019, with the effectiveness date
  being 29 November 2019. The initial amount at approval was $15 million. The project was restructured on
  May 8, 2020, to support Djibouti’s COVID-19 response amidst rising global food prices and heightened food

                       insecurity, as 90% of Djibouti’s food is imported. Key changes included limiting rural cash transfers (CTs) to
                       5,000 households for 12 months, adding 2,500 urban households for quarterly CTs, reallocating $5 million
                       from existing components to a new food security response component, and revising the project objectives
                       and results framework. On March 18, 2021, an Additional Financing (AF) of $15 million ($10 million credit
                       and $5 million grant) was approved to replenish funds used for the COVID-19 response, scale up activities,
                       and extend CTs. New measures included productive inclusion activities, scaling up basic services,
                       extending the project timeline to December 2023, and refining indicators to promote women’s leadership
                       and community engagement. These changes ensured rapid emergency support for vulnerable households
                       affected by food insecurity, economic shocks, and crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and regional
                       conflicts, expanding the project’s scope and impact.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
The project’s objectives were highly relevant to Djibouti’s development priorities and World Bank strategies
at appraisal and closing. The project aimed to enhance the social safety net (SSN) system and improve
access to basic services in targeted poor communities, addressing critical development challenges. At the
time of project design, 21 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty, with poor communities facing
limited access to basic services. The project also responded to added pressures from an influx of refugees,
further underscoring its importance. The project aligned with the Government of Djibouti’s Vision 2035,
which prioritizes harnessing human potential as a foundation for inclusive growth, and the National Strategy
for Social Protection (NSSP, 2018–2022), which emphasized the need for effective social safety nets to
build human capital and extended eligibility to refugees through legal reforms. Furthermore, the project built
on the World Bank’s prior engagement in the country, including the Social Safety Net project, which
provided a foundation for strengthening the SSN system.

At closing, the project remained well-aligned with the Djibouti Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY22–
FY26 (Report No. 147787-DJ), contributing to two sub-objectives: (i) stimulating entrepreneurship and
promoting small and medium enterprise development during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii)
strengthening basic service delivery to improve access, quality, and inclusion while enhancing resilience to
climate change and natural disasters. The project demonstrated adaptability by addressing urgent needs
stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, which exacerbated global food price shocks and
disproportionately impacted Djibouti, where 90 percent of food is imported. Restructuring enabled
emergency cash transfers (CTs) to 5,000 rural households for 12 months (four quarterly payments instead
of six) and extended support to 2,500 urban households for the same duration. These measures were
critical in safeguarding livelihoods during a period of heightened vulnerability.

EFFICACY_TBL




               OBJECTIVE 1
               Objective
               To support an expanded and enhanced social safety nets system

               Rationale
               The first objective of the project was to enhance the SSN system by improving its targeting mechanisms,
               enlarging the government’s social registry, and delivering effective accompanying measures. This objective
               included direct financing of cash transfers to households through an improved system, which involved refining
               the proxy means testing (PMT) methodology, targeting the poorest geographic areas, updating the social
               registry, upgrading the MIS, and enhancing the capacity of local staff. On the demand side, these system
               enhancements were complemented by community-based behavior change sessions, which served as the
               “soft conditionalities” for CTs. These sessions focused on themes aligned with human capital development
               and early childhood development, such as cognitive stimulation, good parenting practices, school attendance,
               malnutrition prevention, hygiene promotion, income-generating activities, and information for refugee and
               migrant households on their rights and responsibilities.

               The Theory of Change (ToC) for this objective was clear and well-articulated, with both demand- and supply-
               side interventions designed to strengthen the SSN system. These measures were expected to result in
               improved health and early childhood development outcomes, while simultaneously expanding the
               government’s capacity to implement and sustain an enhanced safety net system.

               Intermediate Indicators

                     5,206 community sessions were organized as part of accompanying measures to raise awareness,
                        exceeding the target of 1,500 sessions.
                     414 community counselors were trained to lead community sessions, exceeding the target of 150
                        counselors.
                       375 women were trained as community counselors to lead community sessions, exceeding the target
                        of 80 female counselors.
                       95 percent of beneficiaries surveyed indicated they were satisfied with community sessions,
                        exceeding the target of 75 percent.
                       1,609 CT beneficiaries participated in Productive inclusion (PI) activities, falling short of the target of
                        2,000.
                       1,000 women beneficiaries participated in the PI program, falling short of the target of 1,200.
                       82 percent of beneficiaries surveyed indicated satisfaction with the PI program, meeting the target of
                        80 percent.
                       98 percent of PNSF beneficiary households were registered, including with biometric data in the social
                        registry, exceeding the target of 80 percent.
                       41 percent of PNSF beneficiary households were paid within 15 days of the scheduled payment date,
                        falling short of the target of 85 percent (48 percent achievement).
                       1,398 people registered in the social registry were given their national identity cards with the support
                        of the project, exceeding the target of 1,000.

      74 percent of PNSF-related complaints registered electronically were resolved by the time of the next
       CT payment, exceeding the target of 70 percent.
      1,553 refugee households were included/registered in the social registry, exceeding the target of
       1,500.

Outcomes

      5,500 beneficiaries were reached under the social safety net programs, meeting the target of 5,500
       beneficiaries.
      86% of the beneficiaries reached were below the poverty line and vulnerable to climate related
       shocks.
      110,194 households were registered in the national social registry, exceeding the target of 90,000
       households.
      49 percent of beneficiary women with a child aged 0–6 months practiced exclusive breastfeeding,
       exceeding the target of 35 percent.

The PDO indicators effectively measured the enhanced safety net system but faced challenges due to zero
baselines, limiting the ability to compare pre-project performance or establish a clear counterfactual. The
Theory of Change (ToC) linked cash transfers and community measures to improved outcomes, such as the
rise in exclusive breastfeeding rates to 49% (14 percentage points above the target). However, the delayed
implementation of cash transfers—with payments beginning only in early 2022 (ICR, p.21)—complicates the
attribution of these improvements directly to the intervention. Despite these limitations, the ICR notes that
community-based measures played a critical role in achieving meaningful human development outcomes.
Over 5,200 bi-monthly sessions, led by 414 mères conseillères (91% women), covered themes such as
nutrition, health, and financial literacy, resulting in high participant satisfaction (95%) and improved health
service use and child monitoring.

The project also made substantial progress in enhancing the safety net system. It expanded the social
registry to 110,194 households, surpassing the target of 90,000, and introduced biometric enrollment for
improved targeting and tracking. Comprehensive operational tools were developed, including guidelines for
payments, grievance management, and monitoring, alongside an upgraded PNSF MIS that integrated with
the social registry and biometric systems. These advancements strengthened service delivery, as measured
by the world bank evaluations, though timeliness challenges remained, as only 41% of beneficiaries received
payments within 15 days, well below the 85% target. Finally, the project also established the building blocks
of the Productive Inclusion program.

Considering the achievement of intermediate and outcome indicators but with moderate shortcomings and
attribution challenges, this ICRR rates the objective as Substantial.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To support the access to basic services in targeted poor communities

Rationale
The second objective of the project was to improve access to basic services in targeted poor communities. To
achieve this, the project strengthened capacities at both the central and local levels through technical
assistance and training to implement the Community-Driven Development (CDD) approach. Sub-project
committees were established in 60 beneficiary communities, enabling them to open accounts to access funds
and manage infrastructure project budgets. Training was provided on various aspects of grassroots
management, including communication and information sharing, community organization and dynamics,
participatory poverty assessment, operational planning of community investments, and project evaluation.

The Theory of Change (ToC) for the second objective was clear and well-structured. By combining
institutional strengthening at the formal level (capacity building for central and local authorities) with informal
level (community-level training) and dedicated budgets for infrastructure projects, the project created a logical
pathway for improving access to basic services in these communities.

Intermediate Indicators

63 communities vulnerable to climate-related shocks were trained on the identification, implementation, and
maintenance of community sub-projects, exceeding the target of 60 communities.

122 infrastructure sub-projects were constructed or rehabilitated in communities vulnerable to climate-related
shocks, exceeding the target of 120 sub-projects.

86 percent of community sub-projects were functional one year after completion, exceeding the target of 80
percent.

85 percent of beneficiaries were satisfied with the community infrastructures financed by the project,
exceeding the target of 80 percent.

11,724 people were provided with access to improved water sources, exceeding the target of 1,000 persons.

5,803 females were provided access to improved water sources, exceeding the target of 500 females.

3,100 refugees were provided with access to basic services infrastructure financed by the project, exceeding
the target of 1,000 refugees.

1,600 female refugees were provided with access to basic services infrastructure financed by the project,

                            16,027 beneficiaries had to access to basic services, exceeding the target of 6,000 beneficiaries.

                            The PDO indicator falls short of fully capturing the achievement of the objective, as it only tracks the number
                            of beneficiaries without providing insights into the extent of actual access of the infrastructure by the
                            communities. However, this is partially alleviated by some evidence from intermediate results indicators
                            (IRIs). All beneficiary communities received training to identify, prioritize, implement, and maintain community
                            infrastructures (IRI 12), and 86% of the infrastructure projects were reported to be functional one year after
                            completion and handover to users (IRI 14), demonstrating a degree of sustainability and community
                            engagement in infrastructure management.

                            Considering the achievement of intermediate and outcome indicators with moderate shortcomings
                            in measurement and in demonstrating full achievement of the stated objective, this ICRR rates the objective
                            as Substantial.

                            Rationale
                            The third objective of the project aimed to provide a rapid and targeted food security response to mitigate the
                            impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Theory of Change (ToC) was clear and direct -- the
                            project envisioned ensuring critical food access and adequate nutritional intake for poor and vulnerable
                            households, thereby protecting human development during the crisis. This was to be achieved through the
                            distribution of food vouchers, redeemable for essential food items, targeted at households below the poverty
                            line and workers not previously covered by social safety nets.

                            Outcomes

                            27,567 beneficiaries had access to social safety net programs, exceeding the target of 27,000 beneficiaries.

                            Considering the achievement of the intended outcome, this ICRR rates the objective as High.

  Rationale
  The original objectives to support an expanded and enhanced social safety nets system and to support the
  access to basic services in targeted poor communities were almost fully achieved; and the new object to
  support a rapid targeted food security safety net response to the COVID-19 pandemic was fully achieved. The
  achievements are consistent with a Substantial overall efficacy rating.

 5. Efficiency
The PAD and Additional Financing did not include a cost-benefit analysis. However, an economic analysis
estimated that US$56 monthly CTs to 5,000 rural households could reduce national headcount poverty by nearly
one percentage point, from 21.14% to 20.28%. Infrastructure investments under the Community-Driven
Development (CDD) approach were 40% cheaper than traditional methods, benefiting over 16,000 people in 63
communities, with 86% of facilities functional after one year. Despite increased project costs from additional
activities, administrative costs declined from 9% to 7%, significantly lower than the regional averages of 15% in
MENA and 20% in other regions. Additionally, the project’s adaptability was evident during the COVID-19
pandemic, where a swift restructuring enabled funds to be reallocated to emergency responses, strengthening
delivery models and reducing targeting costs. While several project activities were implemented in a timely
manner, the ICR reported substantial delays in the implementation of CTs and in establishing effective payment
systems resulting in actual initiation of CTs only during the fourth year of implementation (ICR, p. 21).

However, the efficiency analysis has certain limitations in its efficiency assessment. The lack of an ex-post
economic analysis restricts the ability to directly quantify project benefits, as pandemic-related disruptions
complicated isolating its impacts. Comparative cost estimates, such as the cost of CTs relative to similar
programs in the region, are also absent. Furthermore, the ICR relies on tentative claims, such as the CDD
approach improving allocative efficiency and the project reducing poverty and vulnerability, which remain
plausible but not fully verified. While these gaps qualify the conclusions, the project’s demonstrates evidence on
cost-effectiveness, strong administrative efficiency, and timely adaptability support a marginally Substantial
efficiency rating. Efficiency was reflective of what would be expected in the operation’s sector.

6. Outcome

Relevance of project objectives is rated High throughout the project duration, as the objectives were aligned at
project closing with the Bank's Country Partnership Framework for Djibouti and the government's policy efforts
and reforms. Efficiency is rated as Substantial, reflecting what would be expected in the operation’s
sector. Efficacy is rated Substantial, as the project almost fully achieved its original development objectives
to support an expanded and enhanced social safety nets system and to support the access to basic services in
targeted poor communities; and fully achieved the new object to support a rapid targeted food security safety
net response to the COVID-19 pandemic.


a. Outcome Rating
   Satisfactory


7. Risk to Development Outcome

The ICR assessment did not identify any significant risks to the development outcome, citing several factors
that support the sustainability of project achievements. First, there is high government commitment, with the
PNSF platform now established as the government’s flagship program for addressing poverty. Second, the
continuation of financing is evident through ongoing efforts, such as the preparation of the Integrated
Community Resilience Project by the World Bank and the Government of Djibouti (GoD), which will sustain
mitigation measures in the medium term. Additionally, the NSNSP 2023–2027 outlines comprehensive
support for all programs implemented under this project and forecasts adequate budget allocations from
government and development partners, including the UN system.

The ICR also highlights achievements such as the functionality of 86% of infrastructure developed under the
project one year after completion, which demonstrates the durability of investments. Overall, there is
sufficient evidence to suggest that the high government commitment and continuation of project interventions
would be sustained beyond the project.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The project design aligned with Djibouti’s priorities to strengthen the social safety net (SSN) system and
  improve access to basic services, focusing on poverty reduction, early childhood development, and

                                                                                                   Page 10 of 15

  human capital outcomes. Drawing on lessons from prior projects and global best practices, the Bank
  refined targeting methodologies, expanded the social registry, and upgraded systems to enhance the
  PSNF platform’s adaptive and shock-responsive capabilities. The design also addressed institutional
  fragmentation, built implementation capacity, and prioritized cash transfers (CTs) as an efficient
  mechanism for poverty alleviation.

  The preparation process showcased thorough technical analysis and effective risk mitigation measures,
  including capacity assessments of implementing agencies and leveraging partnerships with UN
  agencies, e.g., delivery systems, such as the Management Information System (MIS) and monitoring
  frameworks, were strengthened to support cash-plus interventions. However, there was a lack of
  readiness and inadequate risk assessment for implementing conditional cash transfers (CCTs), resulting
  in significant delays; cash transfers (CTs) only began in early 2022. According to the Implementation
  Completion and Results Report (ICR, p. 21), the lack of readiness was attributed to several factors,
  including the absence of financial institutions in the regions and the absence of effective, appropriate
  payment systems that had yet to be established. Additionally, the implementation of CTs required
  substantial logistical support during each cycle and coordination among government agencies, local
  governments, and police departments. These risks were not identified in the Project Appraisal Document
  (PAD, p. 27) under key risks.



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 The team provided consistent oversight. Two Task Team Leaders (TTLs) ensured smooth leadership
 transitions, with continuity maintained despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Supervision
 missions were conducted virtually during 2020–2021 and resumed in-person at six-month intervals
 thereafter. Additional workshops and technical meetings supported key areas such as monitoring and
 evaluation (M&E), targeting, and productive inclusion (PI). The findings from these missions were
 systematically documented, helping to monitor progress and address emerging issues in a timely manner.
 The team also mobilized additional resources, including an IDA credit of US$10 million and an IDA grant of
 US$5 million, by demonstrating tangible results on the ground. Technical assistance (TA) was leveraged to
 update the PMT, enhancing targeting at project inception, and to support market assessments and
 fieldwork that informed the design of the productive inclusion (PI) sub-component.

 The World Bank team also demonstrated flexibility in supervision, enabling adjustments to meet urgent
 country needs, such as those arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The May 2020 restructuring
 repurposed project resources to address food insecurity, while a subsequent AF compensated for these
 funds and expanded the project scope. The introduction of PI activities during this period aimed to build
 beneficiaries’ economic resilience, helping to reduce dependency on cash transfers. The team’s ability to
 adapt the project in response to client needs while enhancing the PNSF platform’s adaptive capabilities
 underscores the Bank’s strong commitment to achieving development outcomes.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The M&E design was well-structured, featuring a Results Framework (RF) with SMART (specific,
 measurable, relevant, and timely) indicators that were logically aligned with the project’s objectives. These
 output- and outcome-based indicators were directly linked to critical activities, allowing for systematic
 monitoring of progress. Furthermore, the inclusion of technical audits for cash transfers (CTs) and
 beneficiary satisfaction surveys enhanced data triangulation and provided valuable insights into project
 performance. However, the M&E design lacked a framework to establish clear attribution. Moreover, the
 presence of multiple donor programs in the region, particularly those addressing the refugee crisis,
 introduced complexities that made it difficult to isolate the project’s specific contributions within the RF.



b. M&E Implementation
  The ICR notes that M&E activities were largely implemented as planned, with enhancements to the
  PNSF M&E architecture, including modules for real-time data collection for new components like
  productive inclusion (PI) and food stamp programs, as well as the Complaints' management system.
  Monitoring of "soft" conditionalities was supported by mères conseillères, who recorded unique barcodes
  during community sessions and entered the data into the PNSF MIS. Extensive training improved
  awareness of the Complaints mechanism among social workers and beneficiaries. While the first
  technical audit for sub-component 1.1 was delayed by over two years, subsequent semi-annual audits
  and evaluations were completed, including audits for components 1, 2, and 3 and a beneficiary
  satisfaction survey for sub-component 1.3.



c. M&E Utilization
  The ICR notes that the M&E system was integral to the project’s implementation, enabling evidence-
  based adjustments to key activities. Research, evaluations, and on-site data informed changes, such as
  expanding cash transfers to urban households, initiating PI activities, and distributing food vouchers
  during COVID-19. The Results Framework (RF) facilitated tracking and timely adaptations, including
  enhanced communication to address low awareness of the complaints system and compliance
  monitoring for infrastructure safeguards. Although the beneficiary satisfaction survey for Component 1.3
  was delayed, it ultimately provided high satisfaction ratings and recommendations for future
  interventions under SPECRP (P178992), highlighting the M&E system’s role in improving project
  delivery and planning.

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The ICR notes that the project complied with all applicable environmental and social (E&S) safeguards
   policies. The Overall Safeguards Rating was Moderately Satisfactory in the last ISR, as recorded in the
   Operations Portal. A waiver for E&S requirements was obtained at Additional Financing (AF) approval, and
   the project was categorized as B due to Component 3 activities, triggering OP/BP 4.01 for Environmental
   Assessment and OP/BP 4.12 for Involuntary Settlement. An Environmental and Social Management
   Framework (ESMF) outlined eligible infrastructures and mitigation measures. In 2022, E&S performance
   was rated moderately unsatisfactory when work began on two sub-projects without prior approval of their
   Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMP). Following a technical audit confirming compliance
   with Bank policies apart from delayed documentation, the suspension was lifted, and additional training was
   provided to ADDS and 590 Village Development Associations. By late 2022, performance improved to
   moderately satisfactory, with adequate supervision and timely preparation of E&S instruments. Social risks
   were moderate, with measures in place for beneficiary selection, COVID-19 protocols, resettlement
   screening, and preventing sexual exploitation and abuse. No incidents were reported during the project.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   The ICR notes that the project maintained financial management (FM) and procurement arrangements that
   were acceptable to the World Bank. Initially, FM risk was rated substantial, and procurement risk was high
   due to SEAS/MASS’s lack of prior experience with World Bank operations. Agence Djiboutienne de
   Développement Social (ADDS, Djiboutian Social Development Agency), with prior experience in Bank-
   funded projects, oversaw Component 3, while community associations managed fiscal and procurement
   responsibilities for subprojects, supported by training on community procurement and FM. No significant
   changes were required during Additional Financing (AF). Fiduciary risks were initially substantial but were
   downgraded to moderate in May 2021 as management and arrangements improved.




c. Unintended impacts (Positive or Negative)
   The ICR notes that the project yielded several unintended positive impacts: (i) Micronutrient packages and
   leftover Plumpy Doz from the project were distributed to households severely affected by the COVID-19
   lockdown, improving nutritional intake for at-risk populations; (ii) The food voucher platform attracted
   additional financing, enabling the Government of Djibouti to support 49,000 households for one month and
   donors to assist 14,000 households, including 1,000 refugee households, for six months; (iii) The social
   registry became a vital tool for identifying beneficiaries for programs by the World Food Program (WFP),
   Ministry of Health, and UNHCR, expanding its scope through biometric enrollment; (iv) the successful
   implementation of PITCH and the swift preparation of the SPECRP inspired and informed the 2023–2027
   National Social Protection Strategy; and (v) the delivery of food vouchers also led to the approval of $30

12. Lessons

    1. Integrated packages of interventions enhance sustainability and impact: Delivering an
         integrated package of cash transfers, productive inclusion, CDD projects, and accompanying
         measures strengthens human development outcomes and builds lasting systems. Under the
         project, this approach improved practices like exclusive breastfeeding, established a central
         social registry, and set up local social counters that continued serving beyond the project.
         This demonstrates the potential for scaling integrated approaches to amplify long-term
         benefits.

    2. Foundational investments in social protection systems enable crisis responsiveness:
         Building robust systems, such as the social registry, enhances the ability to scale programs
         and respond to crises effectively. The registry supported accurate targeting and program
         expansion during COVID-19 and overlapping emergencies. Achieving global best practices
         requires dynamic interoperability, timely evaluations, and improved data-sharing
         mechanisms to harmonize efforts and optimize service delivery.

    3. Leveraging local institutions and existing human resources improves cost-
         effectiveness and community engagement: Engaging local structures and local actors
         such as community workers (like mères conseillères) and Village Development Associations,
         fosters positive behavior changes while reducing costs.

    4. Empowering women in community leadership enhances impact and service delivery:
         Incorporating gender considerations into CDD approaches ensures investments address
         women’s specific needs and priorities. Female leadership in community development

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR provided a comprehensive and internally consistent overview of the project, aligning well with
established guidelines. While the report demonstrated adequate analysis and incorporated lessons from
implementation, its outcome orientation was limited by moderate gaps rooted in the initial M&E design rather
than shortcomings of the ICR itself. Although it presented a thorough account of implementation and
monitoring, it did not sufficiently capture some of the project’s limitations and readiness issues for implementing
cash transfers. The lessons drawn were evidence-based and reflective of project experience. The report was
clearly written and well-organized, but its lengthy articulations could have been improved for clarity and candor.
