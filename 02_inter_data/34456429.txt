EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The Program Development Objective of this series of three development policy financing (DPFs) was to support
economic stability and inclusive growth in Rwanda by (i) promoting long-term fiscal sustainability, (ii) enhancing
coverage and equity in access to critical social sector programs, (iii) enabling learning and development of
children, and (iv) strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for accelerated human capital
development.

The PDO was revised slightly from DPF2 onwards to clarify better “social sector programs” instead of “social
programs” under the objective (ii). There was no substantive change in the objectives.

For the purposes of this ICRR, we divided objective (ii) to enhancing coverage and separately enhancing equity to
critical social sector programs, and objective (iii) to enabling development of children and separately enabling
learning of children. The six assessed objectives are therefore:

        Promoting long-term fiscal sustainability
        Enhancing coverage in access to critical social sector programs
        Enhancing equity in access in critical social sector programs
        Enabling development of children
        Enabling learning of children
        Strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for accelerated human capital development


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
Each operation in the series was structured around four pillars that corresponded to its framing of four
objectives:

Pillar A: Promoting long-term fiscal sustainability.

Pillar B: Enhancing coverage and equity in access to critical social programs.

Pillar C: Enabling learning and development of children.

Pillar D: Strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

DPF1 became effective on December 16, 2020, and closed as planned on June 30, 2023. DPF2 became
effective on December 16, 2021, and closed as planned on June 30, 2022. DPF3 became effective on
December 22, 2022, and closed as planned on June 30, 2023.

DPF1 was approved for US$150 million, with US$152.2 million disbursed. DPF2 was approved for US$175
million, US$168.5 million disbursed. DPF3 was approved for US$200 million, with US$200 million disbursed.

The total approved amount for the series was therefore US$525 million, with US$520.7 million disbursed. The
difference was due to exchange rate fluctuations.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 The DPF series was highly relevant as it addressed key priorities identified in the 2020 Country Partnership
 Framework (CPF) to improve human capital in line with the Country Sector Diagnostic of 2019. It was also
 consistent with the government’s 7-year Government Program of National Strategy for Transformation
 (NST1) 2017-2024. As stated in the CPF, improving human capital is considered key for poverty reduction
 and inclusive growth. This need was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic with its negative impact on
 human capital outcomes as well as resources to invest in them. Among these outcomes, as per the
 Systematic Country Diagnostic (pages 53-54), improving both access and quality of basic education was
 deemed a priority in education. In health, maternal health and child health, stunting, and non-communicable
 diseases were deemed to be the most critical areas. Both sectors were significantly challenged by the
 COVID-19 pandemic, which was already seen as critical at the time of the first operation’s appraisal,
 including its effect on the human capital outcomes of the most vulnerable groups as well as on the Rwandan
 economy overall. In line with the government’s Economic Recovery Plan, the first operation was intended to
 support safety net cash transfers and more effective social services, expand coverage, improve targeting,
 and also improve equity in accessing social services. While the overall series was ambitious and broad, the
 policy actions were very specific and appropriately scaled to support relevant reforms.

The six objectives were supported by nine sets of three prior actions (altogether 27 PAs), representing an
ambitious and complex but logical design, with the PAs complementing each other and leading through a
logical series towards the objectives in line with the project’s theory of change. They directly related to the
2020 version Vision Umurenge Programme (VUP), which is a Local Development Program originating in
2008 that supports safety nets, livelihoods and sensitization, and community mobilization. The VUP, aligned
with the implications of COVID-19, required fiscal consolidation and increased and well targeted investments
in human capital development.

Objective 1: Promoting long-term fiscal sustainability

The relevance of PAs 1, 10, and 19 is rated Highly Satisfactory. PAs 1, 10, and 19 addressed the need
for fiscal consolidation and sustainability. The three PAs were highly relevant, as public and publicly
guaranteed debt was increasing by 2019 and further because of the COVID-19 economic and fiscal

implications. The public investment-led growth model combined with the pandemic-driven increase in
borrowing increased public debt to 71.3 percent of GDP in 2020 (from 62.9 percent in 2019). The PAs were
increasing debt transparency and fiscal risk assessment while optimizing public investments for creating
sustainable fiscal foundations for continued investments in human capital development. Fiscal sustainability
requires debt and fiscal transparency and strengthened management and public investment efficiency, which
in turn creates fiscal space for more investments into human capital development. The PAs were consistent
with the government’s Economic Recovery Plan following the COVID-19 pandemic and with the SCD and
ongoing dialogue with the Bank and IMF. PA 1 in DPF 1 issued a manual for procedures and publication of
semi-annual statistical bulletins including information about public debt and government guarantees. PA 10 in
DPF 2 strengthened fiscal risk management in addition to transparency by carrying out analysis of SOEs and
contingent liabilities. Finally, PA 19 in DPF3 strengthened efficiency by introducing a medium-term
expenditure program with a focus on future project mix.

Objective 2: Enhancing coverage in access to critical social sector programs

The relevance of PAs 2, 11, and 20 is rated Highly Satisfactory. PAs 2, 11 and 20 effectively increased
and regularized a human capital-focused cash transfer in response to COVID-19. PA 2 extended the VUP, an
unconditional cash transfer program, to those who prior to COVID were not benefiting from it by creating
guidelines and increasing the scope of cash transfers especially to those working in the informal sector. PA
11 increased gender-, child-, and nutrition-centered safety net support, created a three-year projection for
adjusted benefit levels, and effectively created a decentralized safety net system by creating a Local
Administrative Entities Development Agency, establishing district plans, and having those plans approved in
district budgets via PA 20. Effectively, these prior actions directly contributed to the objective of enhancing
access to the safety net system under COVID.

The relevance of PAs 3, 12 and 21 is also rated Highly Satisfactory. These three PAs were grounded in
the Bank’s Socio-Economic Analysis of Health Insurance in Rwanda and effectively strengthened the
community-based Health Insurance system (CBHI). PA 3 strengthened financial sustainability and enhanced
membership by the poorest households through subsidized premiums, increasing the level of transfers from
domestic resources. PA 12 modified the targeting household categorization methodology and forms that had
originally been in place since 2002 to be used as an improved system of reimbursement by public and private
providers and monitor costs. PA 21 established a new capitation-based payment system for public providers
from community-based health insurance to all public primary health care.

Objective 3: Enhancing equity in access to critical social sector programs

The relevance of PAs 4, 13, and 22 is rated Highly Satisfactory. These three PAs helped effectively to
implement a new dynamic social registry program (SRP) with the improved targeting system, including (PA4)
establishing the SRP guidelines to operationalize the registry, (PA13) establishing the principles for how the
social registry is used in all the social sector programs, and (PA22) instructed key agencies, including the
Local Administrative Entities Development Agency and Rwanda Social Security Board, to use the new
registry, and approved a national rollout plan. The new methodology under PAs 3, 12, 21 and the rollout of
the registry under PAs 4, 13 and 22 directly contributed to the objective of enhancing equity in access in
critical social sector programs.

Objective 4: Enabling development of children

    Rwanda - HCIG DPF (P171554)



The relevance of PAs 5, 14 and 23 is rated Highly Satisfactory. These three PAs helped to achieve the
objective of enabling the development of children, complementing related investment financing and technical
support by the Bank, through PA 5, issuing a ministerial order assigning decentralized entities to coordinate
and monitor the implementation of integrated early childhood development services, PA 14 introducing a
nutrition-responsive budgeting system that enabled the National Child Development Agency to manage
nutrition-related activities across other governmental entities, and PA 23, institutionalizing budget reviews
through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning to ensure efficient execution of early childhood
development activities. Effectively, the decentralized and inter-agency coordination and efficiency focus were
highly relevant to achieve the project objective of enabling child development.

Objective 5: Enabling learning for children

The relevance of PAs 6, 15 and 24 is rated Highly Satisfactory. These three PAs aimed to enable
learning of children starting at the inflow level in early grades by addressing the persistent, country-specific
challenge that almost half children enrolled in first grade were under-age, only a third of children were of the
right age, and almost a fifth were overage, creating bulging in first grades, overcrowded classes, and
inefficiencies in attainment and learning. PA 6 addressed the problem through a draft law “Governing
Education in Rwanda" regulating entry and flow of students, setting up minimum age criteria. PA 15 set up
norms and standards for public and private institutions in terms of standards, materials, and assessment for
promotion and repetition. PA 24 created modalities for pre-primary education that aimed to increase access
to pre-primary and reduce bulging at first grade.

The relevance of PAs 7, 16, and 25 is also rated Highly Satisfactory. The same objective of enabling
learning from the outcome perspective was addressed by PAs 7, 16, and 25 related to teacher management,
creating motivations for qualified teachers to enter the profession, upgrading teacher skills, and setting up
criteria for career advancement. PA 7 addressed these goals through special statutes governing teachers at
all levels. PA 16 focused on establishing curricula through the Ministry of Education to improve the balance
between teaching and continuous professional development. PA 25 established a ministerial instruction to
register, categorize, deploy, and license teachers in a Teacher Management Information System to be used
from central to district level administration.

Objective 6: Strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for human capital development

The relevance of PAs 8, 17, and 26 is rated Highly Satisfactory. These PAs focused on the objective of
strengthening decentralized capacity for service delivery at local levels. PA 8 implemented a new
decentralized institutional structure designed by the Ministry of Local Government and to be staffed by the
Ministry of Public Works and Labor. PA 17 approved a new decentralized policy including terms of quality
services, fiscal sustainability, and accountability. PA 26 established a new strategy for revenue generation at
local levels, including digital and administrative improvements, projection, and collection.

The accountability part of the objective was served through several prior actions across sectors, from
nutrition-focused budgeting to the registration of beneficiaries, to staffing of education and health services,
and also including the roles of decentralized entities in human capital development. Under PA 23, the Ministry
of Economy and Finance provided detailed instructions on production and publication of periodic (quarterly
and annual) budget execution reports against the budget tagged for nutrition. Under PAs 4, 13, and 22, the
Ministry of Local Government established and applied a new social registry system that makes the eligibility
of key social services transparent. PA 25 improved transparency and accountability in education by

RI 1: This indicator focused on the stock of public and publicly guaranteed external non-concessional debt. The
RI was relevant, measurable and appropriate. These fiscal management tools allow the government to regularly
monitor progress in fiscal consolidation. By adopting the measures under PA 1, 10, 19, the government was
using a results indicator that were clearly impacted by the actions to contain public debt. This indicator is clearly
defined and is regularly updated by the Ministry of Finance which, compared to the GDP declined from 73.4% in
2021 to 67.1% in 2022. Relevance of RI1: High.

R2 and R3 were both clear and measurable. R2 focused on beneficiaries receiving cash transfers related to
COVID, and R3 measured the proportion of households enrolled in nutrition0sensitive direct income support to
households with caring responsibilities. They were both directly linked to the PAs 2, 11 and 20 that approved
policy guidelines, central plans, and decentralized responsibilities and accountabilities to assure implementation
and impact. Relevance of RI2 and RI3: High.

RI4 focused on the proportion of target population to benefit from the Community Based Health Insurance. This
RI was also measurable and appropriate as it measured the effectiveness of the CBHI reform, with a clear data
source (Rwanda Social Security Board). It was directly linked to PAs 3, 12, 21 which increased transfer from

domestic revenues, the benefit package for CBHI was defined and the provider payment mechanism was
revised. RSSB updates these figures regularly. Relevance of RI4: High.

RI 5 and RI6 measured the proportion of beneficiaries for VUP cash transfer and for subsidized enrollment in the
CBHI respectively. The indicators were clear, measurable and reliable and strongly related to the objective of
enhancing equity in access to critical social sector programs. They were the direct results of PAs 4, 13 and 22
creating policy guidelines for the operationalization of the registry, rolling it out following adjustments and
verification, and integrating it with the related social services. Relevance of RI5: High.

RI7 measured the proportion of children receiving the minimum package for integrated ECD services in
accordance with national standards. The indicator was clear and measurable and directly related to PAs 5, 14,
23 reforming the Integrated Early Childhood Development system empowering decentralized entities and
mainstreaming it through planning and budgeting processes. The definition of the results, including the definition
of standards, was clear and has been updated regularly. Relevance of RI7: High.

RI8 measured the net intake rate (NIR) of children at primary 1. This indicator, measuring the age-appropriate
enrollment of children, was clear, measurable and relevant signaling evidence of enabling learning of children as
a result of PAs 6, 15 and 24. PA 6 set up the law of Governing Education in Rwanda, PA 15, set up the national
standards for student transition to higher grades along with remedial actions for students with weak
performance, and PA 24 set up policy guidelines for districts to expand pre-primary education through enhanced
workforce employment at this level. Relevance of RI8: High.

R9 measured the NIR of secondary students, based on the same prior actions (PAs 6, 15, and 24). While it was
clear and measurable, it lost relevance and was dropped because of the school closures disrupting both learning
and student progression at appropriate age to secondary level. Instead of being age 12 as per the new
Education Act, children were on average 13-14 years old in S1 following school reopening. However, the original
R9 targets were substituted by higher-order learning outcomes data that were considered as new RIs. These
can be linked by the DPF-supported reforms in PAs 6, 15 and 24 as well as PAs 7, 16 and 25 on improving
teacher efficiency. PA6 interacted well with PA7, and the associated reforms in teacher governance allowed the
country to hire the greatest number of teachers it ever did all at once and improve class size, opportunities for
remediation, etc. These new indicators of learning outcomes are also regularly measurable; they measure grade
level learning proficiency at P3, P6 and S3 levels and, as such, are highly relevant. Relevance of RI9
(replacement): High.

R10 measured the proportion of in-service teachers meeting professional qualifications to be licensed for
teaching based on the pre-service and continuous training they received. This result was relevant, measurable,
and appropriate as well as regularly updated through the teacher management information system (updated in
December 2023). It was also directly attributed to PAs 7, 16 and 25, as they helped create an effective teacher
management system through the Executive issuing Special Statutes governing teachers (PA 7), new curriculum
balancing between teaching and training (PA 15), and ministerial instructions to determine to determine the
criteria for categorization and grading of teachers to enhance teacher career advancement and management
(PA 25). Relevance of RI10: High.

RI 11 measured the proportion of all live births registered in the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS)
system. This indicator was relevant, measurable, and appropriate. It was attributable to the PAs, as PA 8
through the Ministry of Public Service and Labor (MIFOTRA) set up new staffing structures and citizen
participation practices at district level, PA 17 issuing a new decentralization policy including standards of quality
services delivered at local level, fiscal and financial space for the delivery of the services, and

  accountability, and PA 26 issued a new strategy for local government generation of own resources and
  improvement in efficiency of collection and administration. Birth registration is the exclusive responsibility of local
  governments, and they can link live births with social services and human capital outcomes (such as
  stunting); these PAs were critical and relevant to achieve the project objectives. Relevance of RI11: High.

  RI12 and RI13 measured the improved workload for health professionals, including doctor/population ratio (in
  public health facilities) and nurse/population ratio (in public health facilities). These RIs measured the
  effectiveness of PAs 8, 17, and 26 in improving the workload of health professionals, critical and relevant to
  achieving the objective of improved capacity and accountability. Relevance of RIs 12 and 13: High.

               Rationale
               R1 achieved its target of keeping public and publicly guaranteed external non-concessional debt (including
               SOE debt and guarantees) in US dollars below US$1 billion, even exceeding the target a by end of 2023
               maintaining at US$ 0.811 billion due to the combined effects of improved debt management, fiscal
               rationalization and revenue mobilization pursued under PA 1, 10, 19. Fiscal sustainability remained strong as
               a result of the fiscal consolidation that were pursued by the medium-term budget and accompanying public
               investment programs that focused expenditures on critical areas including in social sectors. While
               investments in these areas expanded (including the safety net expenditures during COVID), total government
               expenditures were reduced from 32.6% in 2021/22, to 30.3% in 22/23 and 27.3 in 2024/25.

Objective
Enhancing coverage in access to critical social sector programs

RI 2 and RI 3, measuring the number of new direct support beneficiaries who receive COVID-19 emergency
cash transfers (RI2) and the proportion of households who are enrolled in the NSDS and ePW and are
eligible to benefit from these regular cash transfers and public works (RI 3) have both exceeded the targets
due to the expansion and the reforms that were directly targeted by the prior actions (2, 11, 20)

Under RI 4, the CBHI coverage expanded, and the subsidized enrollment exceeded the original targets by
over 13 percent because of budget increase and reforms in mechanisms pursued under PA 3, 12, 21.

Objective
Enhancing equity in access to critical social sector programs

Rationale
RI 5 and RI 6, the new social registry system, set up through PAs 4, 13, 22, resulted to better capture the
eligible beneficiaries of VUP as well as those eligible to subsidized enrollment of CBHI, both capturing almost
100 percent as opposed to the targeted 75 percent of the beneficiaries effectively improving the effectiveness
in the delivery of social services.

OBJECTIVE 5
Objective
Enabling learning of children

Rationale
RI 8 focused on Net (age relevant) intake rate (NIR) of children to primary one, reducing the under-age and
over-age enrollment of children and the targets, have all been fully achieved resulting in 62.7% (target 60.4)
for boys, 60.7% (target 58.8) for girls, 61.7% (target 59.7) total. These were directly resulting from the PAs 6,
15, 24, issuing the Law Governing Education including the minimum age criteria for admission, introducing
new standards for student progression and expanding pre-primary education, thus reducing the bulking and
overcrowding at P1 and leading, in the medium-term a more effective and efficient education system.

RI 9 focused on NIR at secondary 1 based on the same prior actions. However, due to the COVID-19-related
school closures, the progression of students to age-appropriate grades were disrupted and the original R-9
had to be dropped, as at S1 students typically enrolled at 13-14 years of age instead of the standard 12
years. Meanwhile, institutional reforms under DPF2, the Government incorporated emergency response
measures to prevent anticipated dropouts because of the school closures and also being prepared for future
shocks by institutionalizing remedial (learning) activities and catch-up programs to address learning recovery.

However, as the original RI9 was dropped, the Bank used the newly presented and updated indicators of
learning assessment results in literacy, mathematics and science and while these did not have targets, it
showed significant improvements that are directly linked to prior actions 6, 7, 15, 16, 24 and 25 as discussed
in the relevance of RI’s section. Therefore, this objective is also considered to be achieved.

RI 10 was measuring the proportion of in-service teachers meeting professional qualifications to be licensed
for teaching. This result exceeded the target by over 50% as the targeted improvements were 45% of
teachers (with a baseline of 0%) and the achievement was near 70% of teachers. This outcome was the
result of the new statutes governing teachers (PA 7), the new curriculum structure for teacher professional
development (PA 16) and the new categorization and promotion for teachers (PA 26). As a result, upon
completing and regularly renewing the specified in-service professional development modules, teachers can
receive and maintain their professional qualifications, indicated through their professional license.

                  Strengthening decentralized capacity and accountability for accelerated human capital development

                  Rationale
                  RI 11 was targeting the proportion of all live births registered in the Civil Registration and Vital Statistics
                  system from 80% exceeding the target of 92% by 2 percentage points because of more HC dedicated staff at
                  local levels (PA8), revising decentralization policy (PA17), and the development of a new local government
                  resource mobilization strategy (PA26). As a result, massive recruitment has taken place, citizen participation
                  improved and revenues (local taxes, fees but also block grants) increased. Arguably, the prior actions were
                  necessary to achieve RI 11 but their impact was beyond this one result, given that this statistic could also
                  directly link with locally administered social services, HC outcomes and citizen satisfaction.

                  RI 12 and RI 13 were targeting the workload of health professionals by achieving more doctor/population and
                  nurse/population ratios. While the RI 12 target was exceeded by 18 percent, the achievement under RI 13
                  was negligible as it barely kept pace with the population growth and remained at baseline rate. As the ICR
                  credibly argues, the PAs contributed to improvements and led to achieving the targets set for doctors, other
                  factors beyond the scope of the DPF resulted in the increase of nurse availability falling short. PA 9 helped
                  set up updated staffing ratios, PA18 created guidelines for credentialing and privileging of health
                  professionals and PA 27 created guidelines for recruitment and management. Meanwhile the expectations fell
                  short in terms of nurses because there has been low enrollment in nursing schools in the first place given the
                  low interests by candidates while abundance of capacities in nursing schools. The government responded to
                  these shortfalls by issuing a new strategy that potentially further increases the health workforce by 2028.
                  Overall, while several steps have been taken to improve accountability in human capital development across
                  sectors, including in establishing a social registry, improving accountability in ECD, education and health,
                  results in the objective of accountability have not been adequately monitored or, in the case of health
                  professionals, achieved.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

All project outcomes are considered sustainable especially given that the government has been able to respond
effectively to the COVID-19 related crisis in social services, education and health and was even able to establish
effective crisis response systems for the future as it created a new social registry and adequate capacities for
targeting of the most vulnerable households with the key social services. The institutions set up centrally and
locally are sustainable and lend themselves to assure further improvements in the sustainability of non-
concessional borrowing, in the coverage of social services, in the further development and learning of children,
and in improving the effectiveness and results of education and health services. The Bank and IMF are both
committed to continue supporting the key sectors through IPFs and ASAs.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

The DPF focused on critical challenges in human capital development responding to ambitious government
reform agenda and to challenges such as the COVID-19 or fiscal sustainability in a timely manner. This was
based on a strong and sustained commitment by the Bank through prior analytical work focusing on drivers of
economic growth, debt management, health insurance, analyses responding to the COVID-19 crisis and on
equity and quality of education. Lessons were also drawn from global studies focusing on human capital
development, COVID-19 responses, decentralization in social welfare systems and service delivery. In addition,


                                                                                                    Page 23 of 27

the DPF built on related investment and DPF operations, including three consecutive DPF series in social
protection, and the Quality Basic Education for Human Capital Project IPF.

The preparation was highly participatory and drew from studies prepared by the Government including reports
on decentralization policy and health labor market assessment, and development partners including UNICEF on
social protection, IFPRI on nutrition, among others. Consultations and harmonization also included the Bank’s
and DPs pandemic response, the IMF’s focus on structural reforms and macroeconomic management and
provision of Rapid Credit Facility to address the balance of payment needs stemming from COVID-19. In
addition to UNICEF and IFPRI, partner consultations included WFP, WHO and bilateral partners, including
FCDO JICA, Korea International Cooperation Agency and USAID. Parallel financing was provided by German
KfW. British-based Human Capital Investment Group the development of policy actions and capacity needs
assessment.

The risk assessment was also extensive and found, for DPF1, substantial operational risks related to the fiscal
impact as well as risks related to the COVID-19 implications. The mitigation of the first included the focus of PA1
on fiscal transparency, debt management and budget focus. The mitigation of the pandemic-related risks
included adhering to the Government’s Education Sector COVID-19 Response Plan and, in consequence,
adjustments to both prior actions and results indicators. During DPF2, the risks remained substantial for
macroeconomic and institutional capacity and these were mitigated by strengthening fiscal policies and
monitoring.



Rating

Highly Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

The second and third parts of the series were based on continues analyses and evaluations of the ongoing
reforms, lessons learned from the implementation and results of the previous operations in the series including
studies focusing on economic update, protection of human capital during COVID, review of the cash transfer
system, review of community-based childcare, public expenditure review, among others.

The implementation was also participatory including the economic and fiscal updates provided by IMF, the cash
transfer program implementation assisted by Local Administrative Entities Development Agency (LODA), and
the Government monitoring of the community childcare scheme implementation, the implementation of the social
registry, among others.

The Bank provided well-funded implementation support through a multi-sectoral team and parallel analyses of
civil service, human capital in a post-COVID period, nutrition public expenditure and institutional review. Detailed
Aide Memoires were produced by locally based and international staff, to monitor the implementation and adapt
the second and third DPFs to changing circumstances and priorities as well as lessons learned to prior phases.

c. Overall Bank Performance

Rationale

Both during design and implementation there was a strong collaboration of global practices across sectors with
continuous consultation with IMF and other Development Partners. The team was also well resourced and well-
staffed providing hands on support to the Government in all three phases of the program, which effectively each
year combined adjustment to the design and assurance of effective implementation.


Overall Bank Performance Rating

Highly Satisfactory

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

Increasing poverty stemming from macro-economic challenges, inflation and especially from COVID-19 were
mitigated by emergency cash transfers to 135,081 households that would otherwise have resorted to negative
coping mechanisms. The proportion of regular VUP beneficiary households enrolled in NSDS and ePW
increased from 19 percent (2020) to 53 percent (2023). The introduction of a new social registry, the nutrition-
sensitive budget, the expansion of CBHI enrollment, and expansion of pre-primary education were all benefitting
the poor and the excluded people and households and improved the targeting of social services.



b. Environmental

no significant impact



c. Gender

Improving coverage, quality and equity in social services, cash transfers, ECD, education and health had
disproportional impact on women who carry a greater burden of care and unpaid care work and children who
have been affected by challenges in nutrition, stunting and limited access to pre-primary education as well as
the school closures during the pandemic. The related programs in the DPF series were, therefore, well-targeted
to address these gender and child development related challenges.

       Rwanda - HCIG DPF (P171554)




The DPF series had significant institutional development impact through the prior actions to strengthen local
capacities through decentralization, strengthen the teacher core through new standards and training system and
through the new social registry system. Overall, the country’s institutional resilience also improved to be more
prepared to external shocks and crisis that could be similar to the pandemic in the future.



10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR presents a coherent narrative of a complex program that spans across sectors, includes a well-
sequenced agenda in three operations and has a complex policy and institutional development agenda. The ICR
presents ample robust evidence for each prior actions and results indicators, their relevance and their impact
along the results matrix. The lessons learned captured by the ICR are relevant and supported well by the
evidence and the findings. The ICR adheres to the ICR guidelines and methodology and even goes beyond
those. It’s an extensive report but the storyline, the complexity of the operations, the rationale of the PAs and RIs
and the abundance of evidence and considerations warrant the size of the report.

12. Lessons

The DPF series demonstrate that complex multi-sectoral operation can work even with a tight schedule when
there is a commitment from a reform-oriented government program.

The program also demonstrated that on-time and on-demand support by the Bank can simultaneously provide
short-term gains, increase momentum, and build more resilient and more effective systems.

Institutional developments, such as a new social registry and decentralized service delivery help the
effectiveness of human capital development but they may require sustained focus on capacities and on
accountability.

Creating robust IT systems also may require more time in other situations and mitigation by strong central
institutional capacities to avoid delays and build adequate capacities.

In Rwanda, the next steps include a series of sector-specific IPFs, including in social protection, in education, in
stunting prevention and health.
