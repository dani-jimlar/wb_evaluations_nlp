2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The program document (PD2, para. 31) for the second Colombia Fiscal and Growth Development Policy Loan
(DPL2) stated the program development objectives (PDOs) as to: “(i) support fiscal sustainability measures and
improved contingent liabilities management; (ii) foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by
strengthening the policy framework for trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green growth; and
(iii) support regularization and integration of migrants.” PDO1 and PDO2 were similar to those in PD1 (para. 28),
except that “sustainability” replaced “consolidation in PDO1 and “green growth” replaced “investment and
competition” in PDO2. These adjustments “reflected shifts in Colombia’s policy priorities…to align with the
priorities of the presidential administration that began in 2018” (ICR, para. 15). (“Green growth” was an explicit
pillar of the National Development Plan [NDP] on which the program was based, but was only implicit in
environmental taxes included in DPL1; a further explicit action was added in DPL2.) PDO3 was added in DPL2 in
response to a surge of migrants from Venezuela.

For the purposes of this ICRR, the PDOs are taken as:

      PDO1: Support fiscal sustainability by reducing expenditures and contingent liabilities and increasing tax
       revenues.
      PDO2: Foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by strengthening the policy framework for
       trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green growth.
      PDO3: Support regularization and integration of migrants.



                                                                                                    Page 2 of 25

      CO Fiscal and Growth DPL 1 (P158739)



b. Pillars/Policy Areas
For the purposes of this ICRR, the Pillars are taken as those stated in PD2 (section 4.2), identical to the PDOs:

      Pillar 1: Support fiscal sustainability measures and improved contingent liabilities management.
      Pillar 2: Foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by strengthening the policy framework
       for trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green growth.
      Pillar 3: Support regularization and integration of migrants.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The Colombia Fiscal Sustainability, Competitiveness, and Migration Development Policy Financing series
(“Fiscal and Growth DPL1 and DPL2”) consisted of two single-tranche operations disbursed over two-and-three-
quarter years (2017-2020), totaling USD 1,418,196,960 of IBRD loans and USD 31,500,000 of grant funds from
the Global Concessional Financing Facility (GCFF), a trust fund supporting middle‐income countries
significantly affected by refugee shocks (ICR, para. 12). The second operation was delayed in order to obtain
the trust funding. It closed as expected on 21 May, 2020.




3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Relevance to country context

 Although Colombia had experienced “robust” GDP growth and macroeconomic stability in the decade prior to
 the first operation, key weaknesses were the lack of productivity gains and heavy reliance on extractives
 (ICR, paras. 2-3). Falling oil prices in 2014 highlighted the need for measures to ensure fiscal sustainability
 and diversify into non-extractive sectors capable of productivity gains. PDOs 1 and 2 were directly and
 appropriately responsive to these conditions. Triggers and prior actions (PAs) under PDO2 addressed key
 constraints on productivity growth, which were identified as “market failures, burdensome regulation, lack of
 economic diversification and insufficient incentives to innovate” (ICR, para. 3).

 The country context changed during the first operation with a surge in migrants and Colombians returning
 from Venezuela in the wake of the latter’s collapsing economy. PDO3 was appropriately added to respond to
 the resulting pressures on public services and the longer-term opportunities from integrating migrants into the
 labor market. The second operation was postponed in order to obtain funding from the GCFF to support
 these measures.

 Relevance to CPF and country development strategy

       The series built upon the reform agenda of several previous DPFs, which had supported adoption of
        the fiscal rule, tax policy reforms, reform of the General System of Royalties, social security liability
        management, improvement of firms’ access to finance, and innovation and trade facilitation reforms.

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 25

     CO Fiscal and Growth DPL 1 (P158739)



        The programmatic DPF modality was chosen because the client valued the continuity of the support it
        provided to the institutional reform agenda and the technical support embedded in the operational
        design and preparation” (ICR, para. 6).

PDOs 1 and 2 were consistent with three of the six cross-cutting strategic themes of the Government’s
National Development Plan (NDP) 2014-18:competitiveness;good governance; and green growth (PD1, para.
25). PDO2 in particular addressed measures defined in the NDP “to increase productivity, diversify the
economy and enable a business environment conducive to growth by reducing regulatory costs, eliminating
barriers that prevent access to markets and strengthening the innovation capacity of firms” (PD1, para. 27).

PDO1 was closely aligned with the third pillar of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework
(CPF) for FY2016-21: “supporting fiscal sustainability and productivity” (PD1, para. 74).


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The two operations had a total of 20 prior actions (PAs; 10 in each) in 12 clusters of reforms, including a total
of 36 subactions (21 in DPL1 and 15 in DPL2).

DPO 1: 10 PAs with a total of 21 actions/subactions

The PAs were adequately based on lessons learned from previous experience and on prior technical work.
The design drew on lessons from the Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience DPF series (FY12/13) and
the Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity DPF12 (FY14) showing that “cross-sectoral
support through a DPF is an effective tool to address the client’s cross-cutting challenges; [and that] DPFs
can serve as a vehicle for deepening the policy dialogue on fundamental issues,” as well as the important
role of World Bank technical support (PD1, para. 29). In particular, Pillar 1 was “linked to the activities
conducted under the previous and ongoing programmatic knowledge services on fiscal issues, including on

tax policy and contingent liabilities,” and Pillar 2 to the “knowledge services on innovation and
competitiveness, including the Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) supporting the innovation public
expenditure review” (PD1, para. 75).

The program documents (PD1 and PD2) generally provided a clear, detailed rationale for each PA and the
expected results – though the latter with reference to the specific results indicator more than the PDO or
desired outcome. Given the variation in the relevance of several of the results indicators (see Section 4
below), this undermines the quality of some of the evidence presented in the ICR. The ICR (para. 23 and
Table 2) did a good job of compiling these into a “Theory of Change” indicating how the PAs were expected
to contribute to the PDOs (while noting that this “could have been better explained in the program
documents” with respect to Pillar 2).

PDO1: Support fiscal sustainability by reducing expenditures and contingent liabilities and
increasing tax revenues

PA1 (measures to reduce Executive Branch recurrent expenditures…including cutbacks in general operating
expenses and communications costs, and establishment of limitation for hiring new personnel) and PA2
(measures to further reduce the Executive Branch’s general operating expenditures) directly contributed to
PDO1 by reducing government expenditures, with a clearly stated rationale and results chain (PD1, paras.
30-31). Given the drop in oil revenues, stringent measures to reduce expenditures were needed to comply
with the Fiscal Rule stipulating a structural deficit of no more than 1 percent of GDP by 2022 (PD1 paras. 13-
14 and footnote 1). With limited scope for further reductions on the public investment side, achievement of
fiscal sustainability objectives required significant reduction of recurrent expenditures. The executive branch
accounted for 30 percent of total government personnel expenditures. The targeted reduction of 0.3 percent
of GDP in personnel expenditures (RI 1) represented 40 percent of the cut in the aggregate budget envelope
of 0.7 percent of GDP as decreed in March 2016 (PD1, para. 32), and together with the actions to cut general
operating expenses of the Executive Branch accounted for the bulk of the expenditure reductions needed for
progress toward maintaining fiscal sustainability. PA1: Highly satisfactory.PA2: Highly satisfactory.

PA3 (government has established rules to improve funding of public pension liabilities at the subnational
level, including: (i) registering public pension liabilities; (ii) procedure for transferring funds across sectors to
assure adequate coverage; and (iii) conditions for using any excess sectoral savings) was designed to
improve the tracking and funding of subnational public pension liabilities, which are a key contingent liability
(ICR, Table 2), representing 7 percent of GDP (PD1, footnote 15). PD1 (paras. 35-37) clearly articulated the
role of the “Fondo Nacional de Pensiones de las Entidades Territoriales (FONPET) as a long-term savings
vehicle to ensure the adequate funding of the subnational pension liabilities” and the importance of
monitoring and mechanisms to utilize savings in addressing the risks “associated with unfunded subnational
pension liabilities and with subnational governments’ financial obligations in the health sector.” Thus, the
actions made major contributions to the conditions necessary to achieve the contingent liabilities
management objective of PDO1.PA3: Satisfactory.

PA4 (tax reform, including: (i) increase in general VAT rate from 16% to 19%; (ii) single Corporate Income
Tax, with lower overall rates; (iii) apply Personal Income Tax to dividends; (iv) single tax for small traders; and
(v) increases in tobacco and liquor and wine taxes) and PA5 (implementation of the 2016 reforms regulating:
(i) treatment of dividends and shares; and (ii) liquor and wine tax) were justified in PD1 (para. 40) as needed
to address Colombia’s relatively low tax-to-GDP ratio due to “shortcomings of the tax system including: (i)
high marginal rates on narrow bases, with many loopholes and limited progressivity (e.g., on income taxes);
(ii) some under-taxed bases (particularly on consumption items); and (iii) high rates of tax evasion across the

board.” Although some measures were more about “improving efficiency and maintaining equity in the
system” than revenues per se, overall they were estimated to “generate an estimated 1.9 percent in
additional tax revenue by 2022” (PD1, para. 42), thereby making a substantia lcontribution to the PDO1
objective of fiscal sustainability. PA4: Satisfactory. PA5: Satisfactory.

PA6 (adopting a carbon tax on fossil fuels and a tax on plastic bags) and PA7 (issuing regulations for the
carbon tax and its operationalization) were aimed at raising revenues by addressing Colombia’s relatively low
rate of revenue collection from environmentally-related taxes (PD1, para. 43). The rationale was based
primarily on experience of other countries with such taxes, leading to the expectation that these taxes would
eventually contribute to revenues when operationalized (but without Colombia-specific estimates). Although
the revenue objective of this tax reform was emphasized, PD1 (para. 43) noted that “tax policy is one of the
tools to help achieve [the] goal…to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” (thereby contributing to the “green
growth” objective that was introduced explicitly in DPL2, as part of PDO2). PA6: Moderately satisfactory.
PA7: Moderately satisfactory.

The high rates of tax evasion were addressed through PA8 (government has adopted measures for
preventing, controlling and sanctioning contraband, money laundering and tax evasion), PA9 (regulatory
framework for subsequent adoption and usage of electronic invoice), and PA10 (issuing regulations for: (i)
redefining qualification criteria for the not-for-profit entities’ special tax regime; (ii) mandating the use of
electronic invoicing by Large Taxpayers; and (iii) reporting requirements for the new transfer pricing regime).
PD1 (paras. 46-49) explained how PA8 would address the high estimated tax losses due to contraband and
evasion and PA9 would “reduce compliance costs while strengthening fiscal controls.” Although the electronic
invoicing regulations would take time to reach fruition, these measures were expected to make a significant
contribution directly to PDO1 by increasing revenues in the medium to long term and to reduce the VAT gap
(the difference between potential and actual VAT collections, expressed as a share of potential collections)
by 9 percentage points within the period of the DPL series (PD1, para. 51). [However, the latter estimate did
not take into account the adverse incentive of the increased VAT rate on tax evasion, and the associated
results indicator had to be modified.]

PD8: Satisfactory. PD9: Satisfactory. PD10: Satisfactory.

PDO2: Foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by strengthening the policy
framework for trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green growth

PA11 (adoption of (i) a customs regulatory framework to, inter alia, improve risk management practices in
connection with custom controls and establish standard procedures for the electronic processing of customs
documents; and (ii) procedures for using scanners to inspect goods transiting the country’s maritime terminal)
and PD12 (adoption of a set of regulations to ensure legal certainty, improve risk management and
implement paperless customs that include (i) identifying the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders
and…more efficient sanctions mechanisms and (ii) simplifying sanitary and phytosanitary requirements for
imports of food products and introducing a risk management system) were intended to address the high costs
and risks that made Colombia trade well below what its per capita income level and the LAC average would
predict (PD1, para. 53). The proposed measures were expected to “reduce the time and costs associated
with border compliance and simplify…requirements for food products, [thereby] improving access to markets
and tilting incentives toward non-extractive sectors” (ICR, Table 2).PD1 (para. 54) provided a clear
explanation of how the specific measures would help bring Colombia into alignment with international
practices and reduce time and costs. The measures appeared to be necessary steps to lay the groundwork

for the PDO2 objective of facilitating trade and growth in non-extractive sectors. PA11: Moderately
satisfactory. PA12: Moderately satisfactory.

PA13 (adoption of measures to foster competition, including: (i) incentives to promote collaboration of cartel
members in detecting and investigating anti-competitive agreements; and (ii) a fixed term and objective
criteria for the selection and appointment of the director of the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce)
was motivated to address relatively weak enforcement of regulations against cartels and price-fixing by
enhancing whistleblower incentives and the independence of the Supervisor responsible for competition
oversight. PD1 (paras. 60-61) articulated the expected results chain leading to improved enforcement and
competition. However, delays in new competition legislation (PD2, p. 18) led to dropping triggers for these
measures in DPL2 in favor of a focus on registration of new businesses.PA13: Moderately satisfactory.

PA14 (adoption of measures streamlining the registration of new firms, including (i) simplification of
procedures through the establishment of a single window for registering new firms; and (ii) the establishment
of a mechanism to identify and eliminate cumbersome regulations) was introduced in DPL2 to stimulate
entrepreneurial dynamism (which is associated with GDP growth) by simplifying the process for registering
new firms (to address Colombia’s relatively low ratio of new firms to active population) and strengthening
measures to reduce the “regulatory barriers and restrictions imposed by redundant and inefficient regulations”
(PD2, paras. 53-54). These measures directly addressed major constraints on competition and growth,
especially for smaller enterprises. PA14: Satisfactory.

PA15 (approval of a national development policy for productivity development aimed to promote efficient use
of public resources by: (i) a cost-benefit analysis for new projects; and (ii) a periodic review of public
expenditures relating to projects in the areas of science, technology and innovation [STI]) was intended to
address market failures and the high level of “productivity misallocation” across firms and sectors in Colombia
through measures to equalize access to productivity-enhancing STI (PD1, para. 67 and p. 57). This was a
reasonable step to lay the groundwork for improving productivity-enhancing factors in public expenditures.
PA15: Moderately satisfactory.

PA16 (establish the criteria and procedures for identifying projects entitled to access specific tax incentives
under the existing fiscal legislation and within the established fiscal deductions cap) and PA17 (improve the
rules for the definition of priorities areas to be funded by the Royalties Fund for STI and improve the
transparency and efficiency of the project selection process) were designed to implement the STI policy
framework and address Colombia’s relatively low investment in STI by improving the incentives and
“expanding and diversifying the number of companies with access to these incentives” (PD1, paras. 71-72).
PD1 (para. 72) set forth how the measures were expected to favor “highly innovative” firms and “expand
emphasis on sectors beyond extractives,” thereby contributing significantly to the PDO to foster productivity
and growth in those sectors. PA16: Satisfactory. PA17: Satisfactory.

PA18 (guidelines to improve efficiency of energy management at the firm level by, inter alia, allowing the sale
to the grid of surplus energy deriving from the auto-generation of energy at a small scale) was introduced in
DPL2 to promote both greater competitiveness (by lowering costs to firms of electricity, which was priced
relatively high in Colombia compared to neighbors) and to help meet environmental commitments (by
decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation). This was to be accomplished through
“regulation of the processes and rules to allow firms to connect to the grid and to sell their energy surplus”
(PD2, para. 59). Although the expected contribution of increased auto-generation capacity of electricity by
firms was only a fraction (less than 1 percent) of total national installed capacity, the cost mitigation would
have a (modest) “positive impact on firm competitiveness by reducing the costs of production for Colombian

 firms, especially for those that are in more energy-intensive sectors” (PD2, para. 60). PA18: Moderately
 satisfactory.

 PDO3: Support regularization and integration of migrants

 PA19 (adopt measures to regularize the legal status of irregular Venezuelan migrants into the national
 economy, to facilitate their access to the labor market and basic services) and PA20 (approve a medium
 term National Policy to, inter alia, develop a roadmap for the integration of migrants from Venezuela that
 includes health, education, water and sanitation, support for children, and housing services, as well as
 services to productively integrate them into labor markets) were introduced under a new pillar in DPL2 to
 address the recent “unprecedented” surge in migrants from Venezuela, a large share of them “irregular” (in
 addition to returning Colombians). This was not only in line with Colombia’s open-borders and humanitarian
 approach, but also contributed significantly to program growth objectives, because “recent studies suggest
 that migrants can contribute positively to economic growth in receiving countries, but that…depends on the
 policy” (PD2, para. 63). Furthermore, the focus on labor market integration (in addition to humanitarian and
 services aspects) meant that these actions contributed importantly to the other objectives of the series, as
 well as PDO3.PA19: Satisfactory.PA20: Satisfactory.



Rating

Satisfactory

4. Relevance of Results Indicators

Rationale

The results indicators (RIs) were generally placed within well-articulated results chains that measured the
achievement of the PAs and their links to the stated objectives. Five of the 14 RIs were introduced in DPL2 (two
in connection with the new third pillar on migrants). However, the large number of subactions (36 across 20 PAs
in the two operations) meant that some of the RIs were supposed to measure implementation of as many as 2-4
PAs and 6-9 subactions. For example, RI 4 represented the net revenue effect of nine different tax reform
measures, some of them intended to discourage usage of fossil fuels and plastic bags (which was not
monitored). Although five of the initial nine RI targets were revised upward in PD2 (Annex 1), high
overachievement of many targets (especially with respect to measures taken to improve the enabling
environment for non-extractive sectors) suggests that the capabilities to implement may have been
underestimated (or risks overestimated). The sources of data are well documented in footnotes in the ICR.

Two of the 14 RIs are rated Highly Satisfactory; ten as Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory; and two as
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

target of a reduction to 11 percent was revised upward to a slight increase due to an increase in the VAT rate
during the program (ICR, para. 42). However, the measured increase exceeded even the revised target
increase. The stated result of reducing tax evasion was not achieved (quite the opposite); however, the overall
objective of increasing VAT revenues was achieved (from 3.5 to 3.9 percent of GDP; ICR, para. 42). Hence the
fiscal sustainability objective for Objective 1 can be considered to be partially achieved.

Relevance of RIs for Objective 1: Support fiscal sustainability by reducing expenditures and contingent
liabilities and increasing tax revenues

RI 1 (reduction in central government personnel expenditures as a percentage of GDP) directly measured a
major determinant of progress toward the objective of improving fiscal sustainability by limiting the growth of
expenditures. . (However, when expressed relative to GDP, it is possible that the ratio could rise or fall due to
other determinants of GDP, making it difficult to attribute the result to the tax-related actions. Taking this as a
percentage of total government expenditures would have provided a more accurate indicator of the impact of the
PAs, perhaps accompanied by a separate indicator of total government expenditures as a percentage of GDP to
track achievement of the overall objective.) The baseline data and target were credible, with data readily
available and used to monitor progress. RI 1: Satisfactory.

RI 2 (increase in the use of FONPET savings for subnational contribution to the subsidized health regime)
directly measured the reduction in the risk of unfunded pension liabilities with respect to health. While
health represented only a portion of total pension liabilities, it was a particularly vulnerable area (relative to
general administration and education) due to inadequate information and “rapid expansion in health insurance
coverage in the last two decades, especially in the subsidized regime” (PD1, para. 36). Hence it was a suitable

                                                                                                     Page 13 of 25

indicator of overall progress. Data were available, and the target was revised substantially upward “in the
second operation to reflect faster-than-expected progress during 2016-18” (ICR, para. 40). RI 2: Satisfactory.

RI 3 (increase in non-oil central government tax revenue as a percentage of GDP) directly measured the
contribution of the revenue side to the objective of fiscal sustainability. It was a reasonable aggregate indicator
of the net revenue effect of four PAs with nine sub-actions regarding a range of different tax regimes and rates
(including some that might lower revenues or simply improve efficiency), but there was no basis for tracking the
success of individual tax measures. While data were available, the baseline figure was revised between DPL1
and DPL2 (from 14.0 to 12.5 percent), and the overall target was reduced accordingly (nevertheless, the
targeted increase rose from a gain of 0.3 percentage points to 0.5 percentage points). RI 3: Moderately
Satisfactory.

RI 4 (reduction in VAT evasion: gap as a percentage of potential revenues) was used as a proxy for the
cumulative effect of a number of measures in PAs 8-10 aimed at improving incentives, reforming regulations and
toughening sanctions in order to enhance compliance with taxation requirements and reduce evasion. Although
in principle reducing tax evasion would increase revenue collection, other things being equal, the indicator could
not isolate the impact of the actions to reduce evasion (and hence increase revenues) from the opposite effect of
the increase in the VAT rate. The only adjustment was to change from the initial target of a reduction in tax
evasion to limiting the increase in tax evasion that was expected due to the adverse incentive of the higher rate.
A thorough review of experiences in other countries provided evidence that a rise in the VAT rate would lead to
increased evasion, although there was no basis for estimating the level of increase in tax evasion that would
have occurred without the measures in PA 8-10, so the indicator could not represent the degree of success
against a counterfactual (only against the observed initial increase in evasion). Furthermore, the indicator did not
capture the ultimate objective of increasing tax revenues -- which the ICR (para. 42) recognized in noting that an
increase in VAT collection (as a percentage of GDP) was in fact achieved, even though the indicator target was
not. The RI4 baseline was adjusted upwards in DPL2 (from 20.1 percent in PD1 to 22.2 percent in PD2, without
explanation), while the target went from a substantial decrease in tax evasion to a modest increase, as a result
of the increase in the VAT rate. RI 4: Moderately unsatisfactory.

RI 5 (increase in the number of new income taxpayers; introduced in DPL2) was a reasonable proxy for the
effects PAs 8-10 aimed at streamlining taxation procedures. It was clearly correlated with the objective of
increasing tax collection (PD2, para. 47), since more taxpayers would be associated with more revenues at any
given rate. The baseline data and target were credible and monitorable. RI 5: Satisfactory.

Relevance of RIs for Objective 2: Foster productivity and growth in non-extractive sectors by
strengthening the policy framework for trade facilitation, business regulation, innovation and green
growth

RI 6 (reduction in customs clearance import times) measured the impact of the various regulatory reforms under
PAs 11-12. The importance of moving to a risk-based system and conforming to international standards was
clearly articulated (PD1, paras. 53-54; PD2, paras. 48-50). The baseline was adjusted slightly between DPL1
and DPL2, and the target reduction was made substantially less ambitious, “to account for backtracking in 2017
and 2018” (the original target reduction was 6.53 hours, reduced to 3.85 hours; ICR, para. 44). The relevant data
were available and monitored systematically, even into 2021 (ICR, para. 44). RI 6: Satisfactory.

RI 7 (increase in the number of firms applying to the leniency program and collaborating with antitrust
investigation) was intended to monitor the impact of competition policy measures under PA13 on the
participation of firms in investigations into cartels in order to sanction their anti-competitive practices (PD1,


                                                                                                        Page 14 of 25

paras. 60-61). Although not a direct measure of competitiveness, it was a reasonable indicator of progress
toward enforcing competition policies. The baseline and target were credible and monitorable. RI 7: Moderately
satisfactory.

RI 8 (increase in the number of firms registered online through the new electronic single window) was an
indicator of results of simplifying and streamlining registration of new businesses (under PA14 and a trigger in
DPL1) through measures to “reduce costs and save time [and] make procedural requirements more transparent
and easier to access” (PD1, para. 65). The focus on entry of new firms was based on the premise (drawing on
research) that “young establishments in Colombia grow much faster and create more jobs than old firms” (PD1,
para. 64), and thus are especially likely to contribute to the objective of fostering productivity and growth in non-
extractive sectors. The data for online registrations were readily monitorable. The target was appropriately
revised upward in DPL2 to include all firms, including registration of previously informal entrepreneurs (PD2,
footnote 51). RI 8: Satisfactory.

RI 9 (increase in the number of programs that are revised on the basis of CONPES) was a reasonable indicator
of progress in implementing measures under the new National Policy for Productive Development that were
intended to improve productivity and innovation in public expenditures and programs, although it does not
directly measure the actual results of the revisions (a complementary indicator of such results would have been
desirable). The baseline of nil was clear, but measurement of the target was a problem: the “methodology was
not in place at the time the first or second operation was approved,” and indeed “was changed after the second
operation was approved” (ICR, footnote 30 and para. 36).RI 9: Moderately unsatisfactory.

RI 10 (value of projects registered in the PAED that are approved by OCAD; introduced in DPL2) was intended
to monitor progress toward involving the local private sector in investment decisions to help “identify, develop
and prioritize effective investments to promote innovation and reduce the risk of government failures” (PD2,
para. 57), in line with the Departmental Plans and Strategic Agreements (PAED). It measured the extent to
which project approvals by local authorities were being brought in line with national policies regarding science,
technology and innovation, to help reduce the wide variation in productivity growth (PD2, paras. 56-57). While
not a direct measure of the desired outcome, it represented a step in a reasonably articulated results chain. The
baseline and measurement were straightforward, with a modest target based on uncertainty as to how well local
authorities would respond (ICR, para. 48). RI 10: Moderately satisfactory.

RI 11 (increase in share of fiscal incentives granted by the National Council of Fiscal Incentives for STI to firms
from sectors other than mining and energy; introduced in DPL2) was designed to reflect the shift in incentives for
investment in STI toward non-extractive sectors, under PAs 16-17. While the indicator only tracks
implementation at the first stage of awarding incentives, rather than the actual expected increase in investment
in productivity-enhancing STI, it was based on a pilot study and “complements actions supported under the
Second Programmatic Sustained Growth and Income Convergence Development Policy Loan” (PD1, para. 72),
indicating a reasonable results chain and a commitment to continuing support for implementation to achieve the
objectives. RI 11: Moderately satisfactory.

RI 12 (increase in the installed capacity of auto-generated and co-generated electricity; introduced in DPL2)
served a dual purpose by monitoring the impact of improved incentives under PA 12 on electricity generated by
firms – which was expected both to improve competitiveness through more reliable supply, lower costs or sale of
surplus, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through more efficient use of electricity capacity. Although the
expected results chain was well articulated (PD2, para. 60), there was no direct indicator of the actual impact on
firm-level efficiency and productivity of increased in-firm generation capacity. While the baseline and target

  appeared credible, the target “was already met at the time the [second] program was being developed” (ICR,
  para. 50). RI 12: Moderately satisfactory.

  Relevance of RIs for Objective 3: Support regularization and integration of migrants

  RI 13 (increase in the number of Venezuelan migrants on the RAMV [registry] who have been issued with a PEP
  [special Permit of Permanence]; introduced in DPL2) directly tracked the legalization and integration of
  Venezuelan migrants into the Colombian labor market, with potential positive effects on growth and productivity
  through “harnessing the medium-term growth-enhancing potential of migration” (PD2, para. 3). Hence it
  represented potential contribution to PDO1 as well as achievement of PDO3. It included a sub-indicator for
  women, representing a gender dimension. The data were readily available and regularly monitored.RI 14: Highly
  satisfactory.

  RI 14 (increase in the number of Venezuelan migrants receiving services from the National Employment
  Agency; introduced in DPL2) monitored implementation of Colombia’s “open borders policy and implementing
  good practices in the provision of services to migrants and support to host communities, from education to
  health to employment services and humanitarian aid” (PD2, para. 3). It included a sub-indicator for women,
  representing a gender dimension – although the fact that registrants with SENA were not disaggregated by
  gender compromised this aspect of the indicator. It was directly related to the third PDO introduced in DPL2,
  though not so much to the original focus of the series on fiscal sustainability and competitiveness. RI 14:
  Satisfactory.

               Support fiscal sustainability by reducing expenditures and contingent liabilities and increasing tax revenues

               Rationale
               Four of five targets were fully met or exceeded. One target was not achieved, with an efficacy rating of
               Modest.

               RI 1: The revised (downward) target of reducing central government personnel expenditures to 2.8 percent of
               GDP was achieved, “in the context of a sustained, incremental reduction in central government spending as a
               share of GDP during the same period” (ICR, para. 39). Thus the specific actions and indicator contributed to
               the overall objective of enhancing fiscal sustainability by reducing government expenditures. Rating: High.

RI 2: Despite substantial upward revision in the target “to reflect faster-than-expected progress during 2016-
18” (ICR, para. 40), the increase in the use of FONPET savings to finance subnational contributions to the
subsidized health regime slightly surpassed the target. This represented substantial progress toward
managing the risk of contingent liabilities from pension obligations at the subnational level. Rating: High.

RI 3: Both the revised target level for non-oil central government revenues (of 13.0 percent of GDP; excluding
the income tax for equity) and the implied increase (of 0.5 percentage points) were exceeded. The increase in
the VAT rate during implementation accounted for 0.3 percentage points of the increase (see next
paragraph). Total tax revenues increased from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2016 to 14.0 percent in 2019 – though
this was actually below the 2015 figure of 14.5 percent (ICR, para. 41). Rating: High.

RI 4: The original objective of reducing tax evasion was not achieved, and indeed was changed to a target of
a modest increase, in light of the expected increase in evasion due to the increased VAT tax rate. Staff
suggested that “the increase in the VAT rate from 16 to 19 percent may have contributed to an increase in
evasion to 23.6 percent in 2017, even as VAT revenues increased from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.5
percent of GDP in 2017” (PD2, para. 47). PD2 (para. 47) noted that “tax administration reform momentum has
been slower than envisaged at the start of the DPF series which may have also contributed to the increase in
the evasion rate.” Some progress toward the revised tax evasion gap target of 23.2 percent was made in
2019, reaching 23.1 percent (ICR, para. 42). A rating of Modest progress is given on the basis of the
complementary data on revenues provided in the ICR, as well as RI 3, and some indication that the rise in
evasion after the rate increase may have been moderated. Nonetheless, the ultimate outcome objective of
the tax reforms was increased revenues, and the net effect of the higher rate was an increase in VAT
revenues (as well as overall revenues, as measured by RI3). Rating: Modest.

RI 5: The target for new income taxpayers was greatly exceeded (even without data for 2019), indicating
strong success of the measures taken to simplify enrollment, especially for small traders and previously
informal operators. Rating: High.

RI 6: The targeted reduction in the average hours for customs clearance of imports was only partially
achieved, even though the target had been lowered. . The coordination needed to implement the various
measures taken to streamline customs requirements and procedures (PAs 11-12) proved more complex, and
had less direct impact on timing than anticipated, Furthermore, while introduction of scanners improved
efficiency, the increased detection of irregularities slowed down processing. Rating: Modest.

RI 7: The number of firms applying for leniency and collaborating in antitrust investigations increased by 9,
three times the targeted increase. This contributed to the objective of raising productivity through greater
competition by enhancing investigations into cartels. Rating: High.

RI 8: Establishment of an electronic single window for registering companies was highly successful, as
indicated by new registrations of more than 3.5 times as many firms as expected, even after substantially
raising the target in DPL2 to cover all firms (not just joint-stock companies). The target was focused on five
major cities, where the single window was operated by the Chambers of Commerce; “the rollout in cities other
than Bogotá un 2019 may have contributed to the overachievement” (ICR, para. 46). Implementation was
supported in DPL2 by a decree and a Presidential directive streamlining online firm registration. Rating: High.

RI 9: The number of programs involving STI that were revised in line with the policies issued by the National
Council for Economic and Social Policy (CONPES) far exceeded expectations. Part of the excess
represented additional revisions in 2019 compared to the target year of 2018, indicating an accelerating
upward trend that furthered the objective of promoting innovation in non-extractive sectors. The ICR (para.
47) provided complementary confirmation that “political will for streamlining programs…was stronger than
expected ex ante.” Rating: High.

RI 10: The value of projects registered under Departmental Plans and Strategic Agreements (PAED) that
were approved by the OCAD (body for administrative decisions) as adhering “to the new procedures for
project selection (using an open, competitive process)” reached more than double the target and greatly
exceeded the expected rate of increase (ICR para. 48). This represented greater than expected willingness of
local authorities to apply prescribed cost-benefit criteria, thereby furthering the objectives of competition and
productivity. Rating: High.

RI 11: The shift in the share of fiscal incentives granted by the National Council of Fiscal Incentives for STI
from mining and energy to non-extractive sectors reached two-thirds by 2019, greatly exceeding the targeted
increase from 16 percent to 24 percent. These incentives promoted the objective of raising productivity and
growth in non-extractive sectors. Rating: High.

RI 12: The increase in electricity auto- and co-generated by firms substantially exceeded the target (indeed,
the target was already met at the time of DPL2, but was not raised). Although there is general evidence that
“improving efficiency of energy management at the firm level will improve firm competitiveness by lowering
average costs of production and by reducing operation and maintenance costs” (PD2, para. 59), no direct
evidence was provided that these expected results were in fact being achieved in firms that increased their
generation capacity. Rating: High

<<NOTE: Rating for RI 12 is based on overachievement of target that was already achieved as of DPL2
but not adjusted upward. Could consider downrating to Substantial on that basis and absence of any
direct evidence that efficiency/productivity were actually improved – though that would have required

                  [PAs 19-20, RIs 13-14]


                  Rationale
                  Both RIs were fully achieved.

                  RI 13: The number of migrants granted a Special Permit of Permanence (PEP) achieved the target, and the
                  proportion of women was even higher than targeted. This achieved the stated objective of regularizing the
                  status of migrants and integrating them into the labor market – with likely benefits also to the overall growth
                  objective. The figures reported represent only one out of nine phases of implementing the PEP, reaching an
                  even greater number (ICR, para. 51). Rating: High.

                  RI 14: The number of migrants receiving services from the National Employment Agency substantially
                  exceeded the target, meaning that they were being well integrated into health, education, water and
                  sanitation, child support and housing services, as well as into labor markets. The number of women served by
                  the Public Employment Service (which accounted for 65% of the total migrants served) fell just short of the
                  overall target of 25,000 women, but the number of women among the 27,140 served by the National Learning
                  Service (which did not track data by gender) certainly exceeded the gap of 2,229 needed to achieve the
                  target for women (ICR, para. 52). Rating: High.

6. Outcome

Rationale

The Satisfactory rating for relevance of PAs was based on their sound design to build on initiatives and lessons
from previous fiscal DPF operations and (in most cases) to carry the agenda forward in successive,
manageable steps. The rationale for each action was well articulated (though the chain of further actions and
results to achieve objectives was not as well clarified).

The Satisfactory rating for efficacy resulted from 12 out of 14 targets being fully achieved, several of them
exceeded by substantial margins. Although the reduction in tax evasion under PDO 1 was not achieved, the
VAT increase that may have inhibited this result (although progress was still slower than expected) nevertheless
contributed to the key objective of increasing revenues. Trade facilitation measures to reduce customs
clearance times proved the least efficacious (for reasons that were not clear), despite lowering of targets.

With both relevance of PAs and efficacy rated as Satisfactory, the overall outcome is likewise rated Satisfactory.


a. Rating

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Pandemic risk: The Covid-19 pandemic has produced “severe, unprecedented shocks related to the need to
protect the health and economic well-being of the population….[widening] the central government deficit from
2.5 percent of GDP in 2019 to 7.8 percent in 2020, reflecting a combination of lower revenues and increased
spending related to the pandemic response” (ICR, para. 73). Although implementation of the DPL series was not
greatly disrupted, the drops in GDP (by 6.8 percent in 2020) and employment greatly “increased risks to the
sustainability of some development outcomes” (ICR, para. 13). To help mitigate these risks, “the World Bank has
assisted Colombia in addressing the economic and health effects of the pandemic in subsequent lending and
ASA” (ICR, para. 13).

Political risk: Public opposition to sales tax hikes in 2021 was much more severe and longer-lasting than
expected, triggering protests and strikes. Congress revised the fiscal reform program in September 2021 to
“take a more gradual approach to fiscal consolidation” (ICR, para. 73). Furthermore, although government
support for reforms to improve the business environment had remained strong even during the pandemic, it was
not yet clear (as of the ICR) whether the new administration that took office in August 2022 would be as

committed. The hope is that the “policies recently approved and instruments implemented” would be sufficient to
maintain momentum on competitiveness under the new regime (ICR, para. 74).

Migration risk: The risk to continued pursuit of the third objective, regularizing and integrating migrants, is
considered low, in that the government of Colombia recognizes “that properly managed migration is a
development opportunity” [and] “continues to prioritize migration” (ICR, para. 75). Nevertheless, “a continuation
of the large flows of migrants from Venezuela would put the support systems under further stress,” (ICR, para.
75), and could undermine public willingness to support continued implementation of pro-migrant policies.

Environment risk: No evidence is yet available on the extent to which increased auto- and co-generation of
electricity by firms have the desired effects on improving efficiency of energy use and thereby reducing carbon
emissions.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Lessons from prior experience:

The overall approach was based on lessons from previous development policy finance operations regarding
their effectiveness “as a vehicle for deepening the policy dialogue on fundamental issues” and addressing
“cross-cutting challenges” (in particular, from the Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience DPF series
[FY12/13] and the Enhancing Fiscal Capacity to Promote Shared Prosperity DPF12 [FY14]; PD1, para. 29).
(See section 3.b above.)



The rationale for each policy action was well documented on the basis of prior analytical work, in particular by
OECD, the World Bank, the Tax Commission, IMF, and academic studies (PD1 and PD2, Table 5). “The WBG
was highly engaged in technical work in all three pillars of the series,” and “provision of TA and ASA in the policy
areas covered by this series were instrumental in developing an integrated approach to the WBG’s assistance to
Colombia” (ICR, para. 78).



Results chain:

The ICR (para. 23 and Table 2) presented a “theory of change” describing how each PA was expected to
contribute to the program objectives, drawing on the detailed explanation in PD1 and PD2 of the rationale
underlying each PA. Although “the theory of change under pillar 2…perhaps could have been better explained in
the program documents” (ICR, para. 23), the relationship between PAs and the intended outcomes was
generally evident.



                                                                                                     Page 21 of 25

      CO Fiscal and Growth DPL 1 (P158739)



Risk identification and mitigation:

“The first operation focused on political and governance, macroeconomic, and institutional capacity risks” (ICR,
para. 68), which it assessed as moderate, though needing some strengthening (PD1, paras. 92-93). PD1 “did
not mention migration as a risk, despite the government of Colombia’s policy response to the outward migration
from Venezuela starting in 2015” (ICR, para. 68).

Stakeholder consultation:

Many of the reforms supported in this series were designed to help implement the “NDP 2014–2018 [which] was
developed in consultation with the civil society and a wide range of governmental and nongovernmental
agencies” (PD1, para. 76). “The reforms supported by this program followed Colombia’s existing system for
consultation on specific regulations,” particularly the tax reforms, which “were widely discussed in public fora and
reflected inputs from many different actors,” including meetings with “private sector representatives and
members of Congress” to obtain feedback on the draft law (PD1, paras. 76-77).

Coordination with Development Partners:

“During the process of preparing the DPF series, the World Bank collaborated with the IMF and IFC….
Particularly with the IMF on the review of macroeconomic developments, including fiscal projections and the
analysis of debt sustainability” (PD1, para. 79). “The World Bank worked closely with the IFC to provide TA
related to pillar 2 prior during the preparation of the two operations, continuing this arrangement during
implementation” (ICR, para. 69).

Coordination with other development partners was not discussed and cannot be assumed.



Rating

Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Monitoring:

The results framework was adequately monitored and adjusted as needed to changed circumstances.

Additional monitoring and complementary support was provided through “simultaneous technical assistance,
ASA, and lending activities in similar policy areas, [including] a series of policy notes…technical and analytical
support on fiscal consolidation…ongoing technical assistance on reforms related to competitiveness and
productivity; and analysis of the social, sectoral and economic impacts of Venezuelan migrants on Colombia”
(ICR, para. 71).




                                                                                                     Page 22 of 25

     CO Fiscal and Growth DPL 1 (P158739)



There were, however, some “minor shortcomings in the supervision of the series,” including the failure to
produce an Implementation Status and Results Report during the more than 12 months between Board
approvals” (ICR, para. 72).

Adaptation:

Introduction of PDO3 and PAs 19 and 20 was a significant adaption in response to changes in the country
context due to the surge in migration from Venezuela, complemented by seeking concessional funding from the
GCFF to support implementation. Although this resulted in a delay of the second operation, it demonstrated the
flexibility of the DPL series approach.

PD2 (para. 93) focused on the social risk and stakeholder risks (especially insecurity) due to the surge in
migration flows, which it assessed as substantial. The addition of PDO3 to the second operation represented an
adaption and mitigation to the growing risks posed by the intensification of migration from Venezuela.

Four indicative triggers were dropped and two revised in DPL2, and three PAs added (two for the new PDOs on
migrants), “to reflect economic and social developments in Colombia and align with the reform priorities of the
administration under the president elected in 2018 and under the NDP for 2018‐2022” (ICR, para. 24).

Two of the targets were revised upward (RI 2 and RI 8), and four downward (RIs 1, 3, 4 and 6) on the basis of
experience during DPL1.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR suggested that “most of the PAs of the series had neutral or positive effects on poverty in the short
term…[and] either positive or marginally negative distributional impacts” (of tax reforms), but without specific
evidence. It is premature to have evidence on the longer-term effects (generally expected to be positive, apart

from the “detrimental impacts on poverty and fiscal conditions” due to the Covid-19 pandemic; ICR, paras. 54-
55).



b. Environmental

No evidence is yet available.



c. Gender

The data on regularization and integration of migrants (RIs 13-14) indicated that women were adequately
included in receiving services and permits enabling them to work and that these were delivered successfully.



d. Other

The second operation was able to mobilize supplementary grant funding to help cope with the influx of migrants.

The ICR (para. 63) indicated that “the series had no significant unintended outcomes or impacts.”



10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR provides a compact summary of the context at appraisal and rationale for the series, explains the
evolution of the PDOs, and gives a coherent narrative of the series and the results. It thoroughly discusses the
prior actions and their relevance to a “theory of change” (results chain). The relevance and measurability of the
RIs is summarized, with credible data (including sources provided in 38 footnotes). The ICR is consistent with
the guidelines in discussing achievement of objectives, other outcomes, Bank performance, risks and lessons
(although the latter are fairly generic).

12. Lessons

Flexibility of programmatic DPF enables timely adjustment to emerging policy challenges, such as a
surge in migration (ICR, para. 76). The DPF series was adapted to address the major challenge to services
and labor markets from a surge in migration from Venezuela that required urgent policy action. Although seeking
grant funding for this purpose came at the cost of some delay in the second operation, the supplementary funds
enabled effective implementation, building on actions and institutions already being supported.

Strong government commitment is crucial for effective implementation of critical legislation and
institutional reforms, based on clear objectives established in coordination with the World Bank. Strong
government ownership, based on “strong coordination between the World Bank and the Government of
Colombia in establishing objectives and defining the RIs” (ICR, para. 77) yielded timely passage of legislation
underpinning many of the actions, enabling substantial overachievement of many targets that were set in the
less certain environment before enabling laws had taken effect. Conversely, the ICR (para. 74) indicated some
uncertainty as to “whether the momentum [on competitiveness] will be as strong under the new administration
taking office in August 2022” while expressing optimism that the “policies recently approved and instruments
implemented” would be sufficient to maintain “momentum on competitiveness…under a new administration.”
