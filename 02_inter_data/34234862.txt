2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The program development objective (PDO) of the Papua New Guinea Crisis Response and
Sustainable Recovery Development Policy Credit (the operation) was to support the Government of Papua
New Guinea by: (i) Protecting the lives and livelihoods of the population during the COVID-19 crisis and (ii)



                                                                                                     Page 1 of 16

laying the foundations for a more sustainable recovery over the medium term (Program Document (PD), p.4).
The PDO was not stated in the signed financing agreement.

For this Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Review, the PDO (against which outcomes will be
assessed) is unpacked as follows:

      PDO 1: Protect the lives of the population during the COVID-19 crisis;
      PDO 2: Protect the livelihoods of the population during the COVID-19 crisis;
      PDO 3: Lay the foundations for a more sustainable recovery over the medium.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The policy areas of the program were structured under two pillars:

Pillar 1: Protecting lives and livelihoods of the population affected by the COVID-19 crisis by: (i) helping
safeguard routine health services while delivering the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations; (ii) providing financial
support to MSMEs for job protection; and (iii) easing the tax administration burden on small businesses.

Pillar 2: Laying foundations for a more sustainable recovery over the medium-term by: (i) ensuring fiscal and
debt sustainability; (v) enhancing women’s voice and opportunities in decision making; (ii) improving financial
sector efficiency and financial inclusion; and (iii) preparing PNG for impending impacts of climate change.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

The operation was approved on June 28, 2021, and closed on September 30, 2022. It was supported by an
International Development Association (IDA) credit of SDR 69.7 million (US$100 million equivalent). The
Development Policy Credit (DPC) became effective on f August 10, 2021. The IDA credit was fully disbursed for
US$98.3 million. The difference of US$1.7 million was due to exchange rate fluctuations between the approval
and disbursement days.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 The objectives of the operation were relevant and aligned with the country context, the broader areas outlined
 in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY19-23 and government programs outlined in the PNG’s
 National Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development (STaRS), Medium-term Development Plan III and
 PNG’s COVID-19 Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan. The operation aimed to address the
 immediate challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic while also laying the groundwork for a sustainable
 recovery in the medium term.

 Papua New Guinea faces numerous interconnected challenges due to its highly dispersed and fragmented
 population, low urbanization, significant gender disparities, vulnerability to natural disasters, dependency
 on resources, and regional inter-communal violence. These issues are compounded by weak governance,


                                                                                                      Page 2 of 16

characterized by frequent government changes, and limited state capability. The country's fragile health
system faced immense pressure during the severe COVID-19 outbreak in 2021. The number of total positive
cases increased from less than 800 at the start of 2021 to 16,000 by May 2021 and further increased to over
36,000 by the end of the year (WHO, 2023) [1]. The extent and rapidity of the surge had placed a huge
pressure on Papua New Guinea’s health system. While the government scaled up its testing, tracing and
treatment efforts, development partners stepped in to provide emergency assistance. The DPO supported the
maintenance and operations of the basic health services (para. 44, PAD).

The pandemic also exacerbated pre-existing economic vulnerabilities. PNG entered the pandemic during a
high political turmoil and a contractionary phase of its business cycle, with GDP declining by 3.8 percent in
2020. In June 2021, nearly half of the poor and vulnerable households surveyed in the agriculture sector
reported a significant decline in incomes, while 25 percent of those working at the pre-crisis level reported a
loss of jobs (MPO, 2021). With 40% of the population living below the poverty line, the majority of whom
resided in rural areas, the crisis' impact was profound, particularly in the agriculture sector where most of the
poor are employed.

The operations of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) were also severely impacted, with a
significant percentage registering lower sales revenue during the State of Emergency period. Reduced cash
flows, demand, and a build-up of arrears were the main constraints impacting firms. As of 2016, formal
MSMEs accounted for 10 percent of GDP, contributing over 200,000 jobs combined with much larger informal
MSMSs, which constitute a significant share of PNG’s economy. PNG government aims to grow MSMEs to 50
percent of GDP as part of its economic diversification strategy, create job opportunities, support women's
entrepreneurship, and utilize it as a poverty alleviation strategy. To support MSMEs, the government deployed
a multi-pronged response during the crisis, including direct support and the simplification of tax filing for the
most vulnerable people and small firms. A fiscal package of emergency health and economic relief measures
was enacted to support small businesses while also providing a boost to market liquidity. The package was
financed by external low-cost loans, grants, and employees’ pension funds due to limited fiscal space.

The DPC operation was designed to pave the way for a sustainable recovery in PNG following the COVID-19
crisis. Prior to the pandemic, the government grappled with arrears amounting to 3.1% of GDP and faced
challenges in initiating new reforms. State-owned enterprises (SOEs), despite their dominance in PNG, ranked
among the least efficient in the region. Additionally, there needed to be more representation of women in
various sectors, particularly in decision-making roles. The financial landscape also presented challenges, with
microfinance institutions finding it difficult to integrate with major commercial banks in digital transactions
seamlessly. Compounding these issues, PNG, being among the top 10 countries most susceptible to climate-
related hazards, had its largely rural populace at risk from extreme weather events and evolving climate
patterns.

The objectives of the DPC operation aligned with the focus areas of CPF FY19-23. The operation aimed to
bolster PNG's macroeconomic and fiscal frameworks during a period of significant external shock (Objective
1.1). The DPC's objective of laying the foundations for a sustainable recovery was related to encouraging
private sector growth and job creation, especially as the recovery would necessitate revitalizing the private
sector and ensuring job opportunities (Objective 3.1 & 3.3). Finally, the DPC's emphasis on protecting lives
during the COVID-19 crisis aligned with the goal of improving access to key human development services
(Objective 2.2).

b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

Table 1: Prior Actions (PAs) and Indicative Triggers (ITs)

For this Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Review, the PAs (against which result indicators will be
assessed) are restructured as follows:

 PDO 1: Protect the lives of the population during the COVID-19 crisis
 PA1: To protect lives and health of the population during the COVID-19 crisis, the Recipient’s National
 Department of Health has provided for the introduction and rollout of COVID-19 vaccination by defining the
 target groups, delivery strategy, timeline and monitoring system through adopting the National Deployment
 and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) and by establishing the COVAX National Technical Working Group to manage
 the implementation of the NDVP.
 PA2: To protect lives and health of the population during the COVID-19 crisis, the Recipient’s National
 Department of Health has enhanced the safe delivery of health services and protection for the health
 workforce by establishing new protocols for infection prevention and control in the context of COVID-19,
 through endorsing the National Infection Prevention and Control Policy and issuing the National Infection
 Prevention and Control Guidelines.
 PDO 2: Protecting Livelihoods of the population during the COVID-19 crisis
 PA3: To protect jobs in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the COVID-19 crisis,
 the Recipient’s National Executive Council has rolled out an MSME support package, which establishes an
 institutional mechanism for the provision of financial assistance to MSMEs at reduced cost.
 PA4: To reduce tax administration burden for small businesses, the Recipient has (a) introduced streamlined
 tax processes for small businesses to reduce compliance costs and (b) commenced the implementation of the
 new simplified small business tax regime.
 PDO 3: Laying the Foundations for a more Sustainable Recovery Over the Medium-term
 PA5: To ensure medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability, (a) the Recipient’s National Executive Council has
 approved the 2021 Budget Strategy Paper that includes a commitment for fiscal consolidation, and (b) the
 Recipient has limited contractual obligations for new long-term external public and publicly guaranteed non-
 concessional debt to less than USD1,200 million from July 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021.
 PA6: To enhance women’s voice and opportunities in decision-making, the Recipient’s National Executive
 Council has endorsed the PNG SOE Ownership and Reform Policy, laying out key principles of ownership,
 governance, and performance, including initiatives to increase women’s representation on the boards of non-
 resource sector state-owned enterprises.
 PA7: To increase financial sector efficiency and financial inclusion, the Recipient’s Bank of Papua New Guinea
 has reformed the payments system infrastructure and rules to provide for instant payment transactions among
 regulated financial institutions participating in the Retail Electronic Payments System.
 PA8: To prepare for the impending impacts of climate change, the Recipient’s National Executive Council has
 endorsed the Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution 2020, focusing on reducing carbon dioxide
 emissions and adapting to climate change.

    PNG Crisis Response & Recovery DPO (P174347)




PDO 1: Protect the lives of the population during the COVID-19 crisis

PA1: The COVID-19 pandemic hit PNG severely in the first half of 2021, with a significant increase in positive
cases and deaths. New health restrictions were implemented, and PNG scaled up its testing, tracing, and
treatment capacity. This required increasing immunization. PA1 was relevant to the PDO of protecting lives
during the COVID-19 crisis. By establishing the COVAX National Technical Working Group and the adoption of
the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP), the PA established foundations for recovery through
mass immunization of the population. However, given the pre-existing low-level vaccination for other well-tested
vaccines and the demand for basic health services, the PA could have been improved by addressing the
underlying issue of low trust in formal medical or overall public institutions through better community outreach,
education and incentive programs and frequently addressing safety concerns. Rating PA1: Moderately
Satisfactory.

PA2: Given the surge in COVID-19 cases, front line health workers were highly exposed to the risk of infection
and viral transmission between patients and health workers. The PA required the establishment of infection
prevention and control (IPC) protocols, which directly contributed to safeguarding the health and lives of health
workers. This policy action updated the 2006 policy and separation of a national IPC policy and guidelines
which reflected new developments in the medical field. Rating PA2: Satisfactory.

PDO 2: Protect the livelihoods of the population during the COVID-19 crisis

PA3: The COVID-19 pandemic had an immediate and significant impact on MSMEs, though the health impact
came with a delay. Lockdown and other restrictions during 2020 resulted in cash flow, lower demand and
disruptions of supply for MSMEs. PA3 was relevant to the PDO of protecting livelihoods by providing financial
assistance to MSMEs at a reduced cost. However, 30 percent of MSMEs knew about the program at the project
appraisal stage, but only 5 percent had applied. The project document does not mention why this type of
support was prioritized compared to other pandemic-related relief programs, given MSMEs' low-level eagerness
to utilize the support package. Rating PA3: Moderately Satisfactory.

PA4: Even before the pandemic, small businesses struggled with compliance due to complicated tax filing
processes and policy and administration issues. PA4 helped reduce the tax burden and simplified tax filing for
small businesses. It was relevant primarily to the PDO of protecting livelihoods while also supporting the
objective of laying the foundation for a sustainable recovery. Rating PA4: Moderately Satisfactory.

PDO 3: Lay the foundations for a more sustainable recovery over the medium-term

PA5: The government's fiscal position had gradually deteriorated over the years leading up to 2020. The fiscal
deficit reached a historic high of 8.8 in 2020, with total debt as a percent of GDP peaking at 52.2. PA5 sought to
improve the medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability. However, the PD is unclear about which channel it will
target to improve the country’s fiscal position. While the overall aim of the project is relevant, the PA could
have given more focus to the fiscal consolidation of the non-resource fiscal deficit which historically has been
overlooked. Rating PA5: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

PA6: State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in PNG account for a major share of its productive economy and lead
the market in power, water, telecommunication, and transportation. However, these firms are the least
productive in the region due to weak governance, technical capacity, and political interference. PA6 aimed to

                                                                                                   Page 5 of 16

 strengthen the governance and performance of SOEs which aligns with the PDO of laying the foundations for a
 more sustainable recovery over the medium term. Efficient and well-governed SOEs can contribute to economic
 stability and growth, especially in a country like PNG, where SOEs play a significant role; however, it is not
 clear that the endorsement of the policy by the Executive Council would result in concrete improvements given
 the challenges with policy implementation in PNG. Also, while empowering women is a positive step towards
 gender equality, its direct impact on SOE performance is not explained in the PAD or ICR, and the theory of
 change is unclear. Rating PA6: Unsatisfactory

 PA7: Digital payments in PNG have increased in recent years. However, small businesses and marginalized
 groups like women still face barriers to financial inclusion that could be overcome through instant payments.
 PA7 aimed to expand the usage of instant payment transactions (IPTs) by ensuring interoperability between
 bank and mobile platforms. The PA is relevant to the PDO of sustainable recovery, given that a significant
 portion of the population remains unbanked and dispersed. The PA leverages mobile technology to overcome
 physical barriers, allowing those without traditional bank access to participate in the formal financial system.
 While the PA aimed to improve financial efficiency and inclusion and enhance the financial infrastructure in the
 country, the required capabilities and infrastructure weren’t available for its implementation. Commercial banks
 opted out of implementing the IPT reform during implementation. (ICR, p18). Rating PA7: Moderately
 Satisfactory.

 PA8: PNG is one of the top 10 at-risk countries for climate change. Extreme weather events have the potential
 to devastate most of the rural communities in PNG, where 85 percent of the population lives. The policy action
 is a commitment to mitigation and adaptation. The enhanced nationally determined contribution (NDC) includes
 commitment and plans across sectors that aim to promote sustainable and climate-resilient development,
 sustainable use of natural resources, and capacity building and governance-related actions that focus on
 improving planning and economic management. The PA, in additional emission country CO2 emission targets,
 laid out actionable adaptation targets that focus on four development sectors: agriculture, health, infrastructure,
 and transport. PA8 is relevant to the second part of the PDO: sustainable recovery. However, given the
 capacity and policy constraints in PNG, the prospect for the implementation of the policy actions is still being
 determined. Rating PA8: Moderately Satisfactory.

               RI2: The second indicator shows progress in terms of the share of provinces with personal protective
               equipment, products and supplies but needs to show what percentage of frontline health workers or health
               facilities had access to or made use of the PPEs. Additionally, the PAD needs to explain the sources of
               the data and calculation methodology. Relevance of RI2: Moderately Satisfactory.

               RI3: This RI is related to economic measures to support businesses during the crisis. While the RI
               measures the impact of the PA on supporting small businesses, its link to the broader economic recovery
               might be more indirect. Relevance of RI3= Moderately Satisfactory.

               RI4: The RI has a direct link to the PA, which measured the proportion of MSMEs participating in the new
               tax regime. The RI includes a baseline and target and is clear on the source of data at the design
               stage. Relevance of RI4= Satisfactory.

               RI5: The RI is measurable, and the PAD indicates sources and is clear on calculation methods. The RI
               partially measures progress toward fiscal consolidation, which is relevant to the PA and the expected
               outcome. However, the RI is too high level, and the present value of the debt-to-GDP ratio could be
               attributed to measures beyond fiscal consolidation, such as increased fiscal revenues from commodity
               exports, changes to the expected exchange rate, risk premium and other external factors beyond the new
               Budget Strategy supported by PA5. Relevance of RI5=Moderately Unsatisfactory.

               RI6: The RI is mostly adequate to measure enhanced women’s voices and opportunities. Women
               appointed to SOE boards is a small but incremental step toward women empowerment in PNG. However,
               the direct impact of this RI on crisis recovery and the broader PDO of supporting the recovery efforts is
               not clear. Relevance of RI6=Moderately Unsatisfactory

               RI7: This RI measures the adoption of digital payment mechanisms. Enhancing digital transactions can
               support economic activity, especially during COVID-related restrictions. The RI measures the progress in
               digital adoption, which can support economic recovery. Relevance of RI7=Satisfactory.

               RI8: The RI is partially relevant to the PA. It addresses the mitigation of climate change but is not related
               to the adaptation toward climate change, which is relatively more important in the context of PNG.
               Secondly, the target for GHG emissions could not capture the impacts of the PA over such a short period.
               Relevance of RI8= Unsatisfactory.

The PDO aimed to save lives during the pandemic. The objective was to safeguard health workers and
immunize half of the targeted population. The PDO has two PAs and two RIs. RI1 measured the number of
people vaccinated against COVID-19 with a baseline of zero in February 2020 and a target of 50% by
December 2022. At the time of ICR (June 2023), it achieved 6.1 percent, resulting in negligible achievement
of the target. RI2 had a baseline of zero percent in February 2020 and a target of 80 percent by December
2022. It exceeded its target and reached 100%, resulting in high achievement for the result indicator. Data
was available at the time of ICR, and the baseline and target were clearly identified. While the new IPC policy
and guidelines ensured the introduction of policy and guidelines, the implementation might be challenging.
Finally, the associated RI indicated the supply of safety and protection equipment for healthcare workers in all
provinces, exceeded its intended target; the supply of protection equipment alone to provinces does not
ensure that the health workers will have access to it. It achieved only one of the two results indicators with a
rating of high.



Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Protecting the livelihoods of the population during the COVID-19 crisis.

Rationale
The objective of protecting livelihoods, primarily through supporting MSMEs, has not been fully met. The
objective included two channels of supporting the MSMEs: 1) providing a financial assistance package to
cushion the COVID-19 shock, and 2) the introduction of a simplified small business tax regime. Similarly, the
PDO included two results indicators at design stage. Although progress on RI3 is assessed as negligible due
to lack of data, the ICR classifies the PA to have achieved its target based on two proxy indicators. The ICR
presents evidence of improving employment in non-mining and overall employment, exceeding its pre-
pandemic level by end of 2022. Moreover, the initial credit facility was fully disbursed to around 1,000 MSMEs
by 2022, and additional government funding was allocated in the 2022 budget. The PA is likely to have had a
positive impact on employment in MSMEs based on the proxy indicators given the significance of MSMEs in
PNG’s economy (10 percent of GDP employing at least 20 percent of non-agriculture employment). Based on
the proxy indicators, the ICRR assesses efficacy of PA3 to be modest.

The achievement rating for RI4 is assessed negligible. The target was for 25 percent of currently registered
individuals to apply for the new tax regime, however, only 5.6 percent had done so at the time of the ICR.
This shortfall indicates a significant gap in meeting the set target.

                      Laying the foundations for a more sustainable recovery over the medium.

                      Rationale
                      The PDO had four result indicators. All except one of the RIs are assessed as modest, mainly due to the low
                      relevance of the result indicators. RI7 measuring the number of instant payment transactions is assessed as
                      negligible as it significantly fell short of its intended target. The result indicator RI5 related to fiscal
                      consolidation (debt-to-GDP) is too high level and does not indicate impact as a result of the PA. RI6 and RI8
                      are rated moderately unsatisfactory for relevance, resulting in the modest achievement despite relatively high
                      achievement of the target. Increasing the number of female board members of SOEs is not likely to have a
                      significant impact on the performance of the SOE sector and the overall recovery from the COVID-19
                      shock. Similarly, the decline in GHG emissions could be mainly attributed to pandemic-induced reduction in
                      economic activities and not a direct contribution from the PA.

      Rationale

      The outcome of the operation is assessed as moderately unsatisfactory. The score assigned is a combination of
      moderately satisfactory for the relevance of PA and moderately unsatisfactory for the achievement of objectives.

      The program was designed in a high-risk, low-capacity, geographically dispersed, politically fragmented and
      volatile context with a compressed timeline. The selection of PA was relatively well designed given the context;
      however, lessons from other fragile contexts did not explicitly inform the design process. The implementation of
      PAs on vaccination and MSMEs was specifically hindered by low trust in public institutions. RI needed to be

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The PAs undertaken by this program were designed to address key challenges in PNG. However, there are
significant risks that could threaten their sustainability.

      Institutional Risks: There are significant risks arising from institutional trust deficiency in the case of
       PNG and the sustainability of all outcomes of this operation. Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is low
       due to the low trust as well as low public risk perception of COVID-19 vis a vis other fragility in
       the country, including security risks. Furthermore, MSMEs’ low eagerness to benefit from government
       fiscal measures or simplified tax policy is due to a perception of the temporary nature of the policy
       change, which requires them to undergo a cumbersome bureaucratic process only to return to old
       procedures and policies. Similar concerns also pose risks to the digitization process.
      Political and Governance Risks: The political environment in PNG can be unpredictable due to
       frequent motions of no-confidence in Parliament and shifting governing coalitions and the resulting
       policy priorities. Such vulnerabilities are specifically important for policy reforms related to the broader
       agenda of fiscal consolidation and increasing women's voice in decision-making roles. Fragilities in
       these aspects could also lead to delays in major resource projects, exacerbating fiscal as well as
       macroeconomic risks.
      Environmental and Social Risks: PNG's vulnerability to climate risks and natural disasters,
       combined with a weak policy framework and institutional capacity, poses substantial environmental
       and social risks. PNG lacks a social protection system, which makes it difficult to reach vulnerable
       segments of the country during shocks. As a result, major disaster events are highly likely to
       destabilize budget execution and divert policy efforts.
      Fiduciary Risks: Weaknesses in PFM, procurement, and foreign exchange control environments
       contribute to high fiduciary risks, which previous operations have flagged. Audit findings from
       previous operations have revealed weaknesses in funds flow.


8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale


The DPO was designed as a crisis response DPO to support the government budget as well as with policy
measures to mitigate the immediate impact of the pandemic and medium-term recovery. The team faced a
compressed timeline, COVID-related restrictions, a volatile political context, data availability and significant


                                                                                                        Page 12 of 16

social protection gaps in the context of Papua New Guinea. PAs’ selection was grounded on sound
analytics, including core ASAs of the World Bank and external reports. The policy action on fiscal
consolidation was informed by PNG Public Financial Review, Debt Management Performance
Assessment, and Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) reports. At the same time, the PA on IPTs was based
on WB-IMF FSAP (2011). The remaining PAs related to cushioning the immediate effect of the pandemic
were based on short notes, surveys, external reports, and analysis. They were informed by experience
through IPF operations of the Bank, including IFC operations. Most of the PAs were coordinated with other
stakeholders such as the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Health
Organization (WHO). The program was also consulted with the government, supporting the authority’s
plans for immediate action as well as its medium-term recovery. The team has ensured consultations and
cooperation with major stakeholders, indicating a collaborative approach in the design of the DPO. Health-
related PA were coordinated with WHO and aligned with their recommendations. PAs on MSMEs and IPTs
were closely coordinated with the IFC team, where they have a more in-depth engagement in PNG. PA5
and PA7 were coordinated with ADB and United Nations, respectively. The project design was informed by
an assessment of relevant risks and their mitigation measures. These included political, environmental,
macroeconomic, climate and capacity risks.

Lessons from other FCV experiences, however, didn’t explicitly inform the design of this operation, while
political instability and fragmentation led the team to avoid a programmatic series of operations. The
design of several PAs was weak and insufficient. For example, immunization against COVID-19 could
have been complemented by outreach measures to increase information regarding vaccination,
overcoming the challenge of trust in public institutions. Similarly, the low outcome rating of the MSMEs
shows that the small businesses were less responsive to reducing tax burden. Measures to reduce
compliance costs, such as easing the filing of taxes, could have been more impactful as MSMEs have
reported issues around meeting the bureaucratic requirements of the tax administration processes. Finally,
the PA on increasing women’s role in SOE decision-making had a weak result chain to the performance of
SOEs.




Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Some targets set for the RIs were overly ambitious, neglecting capacity constraints or implementation ability.
There's a need for a balanced M&E framework that avoids setting unrealistic targets. Several RIs were weakly
linked to the PAs, reducing the utility of the M&E framework as a tool to assess progress.

While data availability challenges are acknowledged, specific monitoring mechanisms, interim target tracking,
and data collection processes are not discussed. There is limited evidence regarding regular monitoring and
tracking of results indicators during DPO implementation and after the project closing. Donor coordination is
noted as a strength during DPO preparation, with engagement across key partners like IMF, UN, and the

                                                                                                  Page 13 of 16

Australian government. However, there was limited effort to coordinate with the development partners during
the implementation phase. Due to the lack of including FCV dimension during the design of the operations,
coordination with humanitarian or security actors is non-existent. The operation was also limited in terms of
consulting with beneficiary stakeholders for feedback. Given the standalone nature of the operations, issues
related to adaptation and revision to triggers, result indicators or targets are not applicable.



Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory

c. Overall Bank Performance

Rationale

The Bank showcased sound foresight in the design phase, aligning the DPO with the immediate needs of
Papua New Guinea during a crisis while also focusing on recovery efforts. The collaborative approach,
grounded in comprehensive analytics, was a strength. However, certain PAs could have been more robustly
designed for greater impact. In the implementation phase, while the Bank was adept at risk identification,
there were gaps in risk mitigation, especially concerning fiduciary risks and monitoring mechanisms. The
absence of a clear adaptation strategy based on lessons learned also posed challenges.


Overall Bank Performance Rating

Moderately Unsatisfactory

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

The ICR endorses the program to have either a positive or neutral impact on poverty and other social outcomes.
The PA on vaccination (PA1), support to MSMEs (PA3 and PA4) and climate change (PA9) are expected to
have a positive impact. These measures aim to increase immunization and protect jobs and livelihoods of the
poor. However, the ICR does not produce any evidence if the fiscal consolidation (PA5) measure had any
negative impact depending on how fiscal consolidation was achieved as to whether pro-poor expenditures were
reduced. In the long run, achieving fiscal and debt sustainability will lead to better allocation of resources for
social programs.

The ICR describes the operation to have a net positive environmental impact. Except PA7, which is highly likely to
have a direct positive impact on environmental outcomes, all other PAs are considered not to have any significant
positive or negative impacts.



c. Gender

The ICR describes the program as having a net positive impact on gender. The project has a net positive impact
on gender. None of the PAs are expected to have any adverse impact on gender issues. PA1 and PA5,
respectively, are expected to have a gender response approach and give decision-making power to women,
respectively.

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The quality of ICR is assessed as substantial. The ICR provides a comprehensive narrative of the program. It
provides a good overview of relevance to context, theory of change and critique of the operations. The logical
flow aids in understanding the context, objectives, and outcomes. The ICR offers a comprehensive analysis of
the challenges, the rationale behind each prior action, and the expected outcomes. It links evidence to
interventions and outcomes through a coherent results chain, indicating a balanced interrogation of the
evidence. It also provides a thorough assessment of risks and challenges faced by the team and the
operations. However, the ICR does not substantially apply or integrate an FCV perspective or analytical lens
despite PNG facing high FCV challenges. Key aspects like social dynamics and security risks remain
unincorporated in assessing outcomes and sustainability.

12. Lessons

The ICR lists the following lessons, and IEG assesses the lessons to be important and adequate.

Vaccination Hesitancy: Understanding and addressing vaccination hesitancy is crucial. Factors like social
norms, trust in the implementing institutions, and health worker recommendations play a significant role.
Structural barriers, especially for marginalized populations, need to be addressed in vaccination programs.

M&E Framework Balance: The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework should balance the government's
reform ambition with realism. Overly ambitious targets, neglecting capacity or implementation constraints, can
be counterproductive. The World Bank should support government ambitions while setting realistic program
inclusions. The design of the program should ensure strong linkages between desired results and the actions to
achieve them. The preparation of new operations is currently in the early stages, and the team is proceeding
cautiously, given the challenging context. The lessons from other fragile contexts are being carefully considered.

Enhancing M&E Framework: The M&E framework should have a strong linkage between Results Indicators
(RIs) and Prior Actions (PAs). Weak linkages reduce the framework's utility in assessing progress. Designing a
Development Policy Operation (DPO) program should start with the desired results and then identify the PAs to
achieve them. Addressing data collection gaps and improving M&E capacity is also vital for effective program
monitoring.

Capacity Constraints: Capacity limitations, such as geographical challenges, technical unpreparedness, and
taxpayer compliance, can hinder reform programs. It's essential to consider these constraints in program design
and the M&E framework. Relying solely on short-term Technical Assistance can be risky without long-term
project engagement.
