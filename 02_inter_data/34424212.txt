2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to contribute to the Government of Mongolia’s (GOM's) efforts
   to strengthen fiscal and financial stability and improve the quality of expenditure management (Financing
   Agreement, p. 5).

   For purposes of this Review, three objectives are assessed:

       1. Strengthen fiscal stability

                                                                                               Page 1 of 22

     SFFSP (P161048)



        2. Strengthen financial stability
        3. Improve the quality of expenditure management

   At a November 2021 restructuring, a change in project activities led to one outcome indicator being replaced
   with an intermediate results indicator, somewhat lowering the ambition of the financial stability objective.
   However, because a split rating methodology would not affect the ratings, as that objective would be rated the
   same under both the original and revised indicators, a split rating is not undertaken in this assessment.



b. Were the project objectives/key associated outcome targets revised during implementation?
  Yes

  Did the Board approve the revised objectives/key associated outcome targets?
  No

c. Will a split evaluation be undertaken?
   No

d. Components
   The beneficiaries of the project were the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of Labor and Social
   Protection (MLSP), the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), the Finance Regulatory Commission (FRC), and other
   related agencies whose human resources and institutional capacity were to be enhanced.

   The project consisted of the following five components:

   Component A: Strengthening Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management (appraisal: US$2.71 million;
   actual: US$2.04 million) contained three subcomponents.

   Under Subcomponent A.1, improving macroeconomic policy tools and enhancing research
   capacity, proposed activities were focused on upgrading macroeconomic models and enhancing forecasting
   and data analysis skills through targeted training. Proposed activities also included the establishment of an
   independent Fiscal Council to oversee government fiscal planning, the creation of a forum for civil society
   engagement in fiscal discussions, and the conduct of detailed economic research on the current
   socioeconomic context.

   The proposed activities under Subcomponent A.2, strengthening fiscal policy and planning, focused
   on developing amendments to the Integrated Budget Law to expand budget coverage by incorporating
   unreported fiscal relations, such as public private partnerships (PPPs), contingent liabilities, off-budget
   spending, and future pension liabilities. The project also aimed to provide support for tax policy formulation,
   including assessing tax burdens, revising tax laws, and addressing international taxation issues. Technical
   assistance was also to be offered in areas such as transfer pricing, integrated tax file numbers, and
   improving the value-added tax refund system. The project also sought to support the building of a
   comprehensive revenue forecasting model, with additional inputs such as commodity prices and economic
   indicators, and piloting the model for large projects. Finally, the project aimed to support extensive media
   coverage and public consultations on fiscal legislation, tax policies, and proposed tax increases.

The specific activities under Subcomponent A.3, strengthening capacity for debt management and external
development financing operations, focused on improving the regulatory framework for issuing and trading
international and domestic government bonds, as well as refining government on-lending procedures.
Support was also to be provided for the preparation of the Government Medium-Term Debt Management
Strategy, including the development of an implementation action plan and periodic reports. Additionally, a
platform and database were to be created to establish direct contact with investors and enhance
relationships. Public outreach activities were to be promoted to inform the public about government debt
and debt-related legislation, while training programs were to be implemented to improve MOF debt
management capacity. The activities also aimed to strengthen the legal framework for planning and
executing development financing projects, enhance the MOF’s capacity to assess project effectiveness, and
create an Oracle Database Application for better portfolio management.

Component B: Improving the Efficiency of Public Financial Management (appraisal: US$3.8 million;
actual: US$5.14 million) contained four subcomponents.

Subcomponent B.1, improving budget credibility and execution, aimed to strengthen the Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework (MTFF) process by improving regulatory frameworks, fiscal forecasting, and budget
alignment. Proposed activities included improving budget planning, expenditure preparation, and execution
processes, with technical assistance for MOF and ministries. It also focused on improving budget control,
internal audit, and risk management.

Proposed activities under Subcomponent B.2, increasing budget comprehensiveness and
transparency, included strengthening government accounting, financial reporting, and audit oversight, as
well as enhancing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), cash
management, and Treasury operations by updating the Integrated Financial Management Information
System to support International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) implementation.

Subcomponent B.3, strengthening public financial management (PFM) institutional capacity, aimed to
strengthen the MOF through functional reviews and process reengineering. It included capacity building and
training programs on PFM, information and communications technology, leadership, fiscal transparency,
and citizen engagement.

Subcomponent B.4 strengthening public investment management (PIM), focused on developing PIM
operational guidelines, rationalizing underperforming projects, and creating processes for adequate
maintenance funding. Specialized training programs were also provided for high-expenditure planning and
investment offices.

At a November 2021 restructuring, Component B was revised to include activities to enhance budget control
through an Integrated Payroll System (IPS), and upgrades to the GFMIS were revised to emphasize
operational customization and improved system integration, reflecting the aim for greater
interoperability with other systems, including the Public Investment Management Information
System and Treasury web portal.

Component C: Enhancing Financial Sector Stability (appraisal: US$2.85 million; actual: US$2.35
million) contained five subcomponents.

Subcomponent C.1, developing and implementing a financial sector development strategy, focused on
creating a Financial Sector Medium-term Development Strategy (2017–2025) to enhance financial stability,
efficiency, and inclusiveness. It included developing an action plan, training civil servants in regulatory

                                                                                               Page 3 of 22

agencies, creating a crisis management strategy, strengthening risk evaluation and sustainable mortgage
programs, and improving legislation on foreign exchange and saving/credit cooperatives.

Subcomponent C.2, supporting the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), involved reviewing and
amending the Development Bank Law to align with audit recommendations, improving DBM’s governance
and risk management, and building capacity to prepare feasibility studies for large infrastructure projects.

Subcomponent C.3, strengthening financial safety nets, aimed to improve financial safety net knowledge,
crisis preparedness, and management tools. It also fostered cooperation among safety net institutions and
streamlined legislative processes for safety net frameworks.

Subcomponent C.4, strengthening the FRC, included launching a midterm capacity-building program for
FRC inspection officers, supporting the drafting of non-bank financial market laws, and reviewing the legal
environment for securities, insurance, and microfinance markets.

Subcomponent C.5, improving the capacity of the BOM, sought to enhance countercyclical policy
formulation, design a macro-prudential framework, strengthen the Fiscal Stability Council (FSC), upgrade
credit information systems, increase anti-money laundering training, and improve research capabilities in
microeconomics with professional software access.

Component D: Strengthening of the Social Protection System (appraisal US$2.00 million; actual:
US$1.79 million) contained two subcomponents.

Subcomponent D.1, strengthening social welfare design, targeting, operations, and performance, focused
on improving the equity and efficiency of the social welfare system by consolidating fragmented programs
and enhancing both monetary and non-monetary support. The project sought to support the design and
implementation of a comprehensive reform of welfare services, improve the accuracy of the proxy means
test poverty targeting system through verification measures, and expand the use of the Integrated
Household Database. Additionally, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support, and
enhancements to the Welfare Administration Information System were to be undertaken to strengthen
program delivery and support evidence-based policy making.

Subcomponent D.2, strengthening social insurance design, governance, and financial management, aimed
to translate pension reforms into specific legal provisions and strengthen the institutional arrangements for
social insurance schemes, particularly through technical assistance to improve the pension system's
sustainability. The project sought to support an increase in coverage among informal workers, develop legal
frameworks for private pensions, and improve non-pension elements like disability, survivorship, and
maternity benefits. At the same time, proposed governance and accountability reforms were to be
undertaken to enhance financial control, audit practices, and benefit processing, while public awareness
efforts were to build consensus around pension reform needs. In-house actuarial and technical capacities
were to be developed to ensure data-driven policy making,

Component E: Project Management and Monitoring (appraisal: US$0.64 million; actual: US$0.87
million) was to support project management, implementation, coordination, and M&E, including audit
arrangements, reporting requirements, procurement, and financial management activities.

e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
   Project Cost: Total project cost at appraisal was US$12 million. The actual amount disbursed was
   US$12.19 million, with the difference due to exchange rate fluctuations.

   Financing: The project was financed by a credit from the International Development Association (IDA) of
   SDR6.0 million (US$8.2 million equivalent) and an IDA hard-term credit of SDR2.8 million (US$3.8 million
   equivalent).

   Borrower Contribution: The Borrower did not contribute any funds to the project.

   Dates: The project was approved on 9 June 2017 and became effective on 11 September 2017. A mid-term
   review (MTR) was conducted on 15 April 2020. Initially, the project was projected to close on 31 January
   2022, but it actually closed on 31 December 2023.

   The project was restructured twice during its lifetime.

   First restructuring (November 2021): This restructuring extended the project closing date by 15 months to
   30 June 2023. The Mid-Term Review (MTR) had noted substantial progress in components A, B, and C,
   contributing to progress on several intermediate indicators. However, delays caused by COVID-19 and the
   2020 Parliamentary elections, which led to the creation of a new Ministry of Economy and Development
   (MED), required an extension of the project closing date and revisions to the Results Framework. The latter
   included changes to the PDO indicator “Financial sector stability improved by decreasing percentage of
   non-performing loans (NPLs)”. The indicator was revised as it no longer adequately represented the main
   project activities, and there were issues with how NPLs were recognized and measured. Instead, a new
   indicator, “regulatory framework for the financial sector improved as measured by the number of new or
   revised legal acts submitted to Parliament,” was adopted.

   Furthermore, the first restructuring led to the addition of an intermediate result indicator (IRI) for the design
   and implementation of a digital payout system, and the introduction of a new Component B IRI related to an
   Integrated Payroll System. Component B’s GFMIS IRI was also revised, and the Component D IRI related
   to social welfare consolidation was updated to reflect submission of a draft law to Parliament.

   Second restructuring (April 2023). This restructuring extended the project closing date by an additional six
   months to 31 December 2023. The purpose of the extension was to allow additional time to achieve project
   objectives.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
Relevance to country context: At the time of project appraisal, Mongolia was navigating the dual
challenge of harnessing long-term opportunities while mitigating short-term vulnerabilities and risks. The
country had experienced a period of significant economic growth, driven by an investment and mining
boom, making it the world's fastest-growing economy in 2011. However, this growth was uneven and
closely tied to fluctuations in international commodity markets, leading to fiscal volatility. By 2016, growth

                                                                                                       Page 5 of 22

had decelerated sharply from 11.6 percent in 2013 to just 1 percent, driven by a collapse in foreign direct
investment and falling mineral prices. This resulted in large fiscal deficits, peaking at 19 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2016, and a corresponding increase in public debt, which exceeded 40 percent
of GDP (PAD, p. 8). The introduction of an MTFF, legalized fiscal rules, and tighter control over budget
execution had failed to prevent volatile and unsustainable fiscal outcomes.

In terms of financial stability, Mongolia's banking sector, which held 95 percent of the country's financial
assets, was dominated by high ownership concentration and limited competition. Asset quality was
deteriorating, and there were significant regulatory and developmental gaps in key institutions such as the
BOM, FRC, and the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Mongolia (DICOM). Weaknesses in financial
oversight, inadequate risk management, and a lack of crisis preparedness in these institutions further
undermined financial sector stability. Moreover, the DBM had become a major source of government-
guaranteed borrowing, raising concerns about its governance and the fiscal risks associated with its
operations (PAD, p. 9).

Despite efforts to improve transparency, such as the adoption of the Glass Account Law (a 2014 law
requiring that government entities and state-owned enterprises disclose detailed financial and operational
information on a public website), issues with citizen engagement persisted. This was reflected in Mongolia's
low ranking in the 2015 Open Budget Index (OBI) report, which underscored the need for greater
transparency and participation in public financial management. The 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) further highlighted these challenges, emphasizing the importance of
strengthening fiscal discipline and public involvement in budget processes.

Expenditure management was another critical issue. Despite higher public investment levels compared to
other countries, Mongolia’s public investment did not result in more efficient public spending or improved
infrastructure financing and service delivery. The PIM system was weakened by a fragile legal framework,
poor project planning, and insufficient evaluation of projects. Furthermore, PPPs and concessions were
often managed outside the formal PIM system, introducing additional risks and inefficiencies. This situation
highlighted the need to improve the existing PIM system and to assess the country’s capacity to implement
effective projects in a macroeconomically sustainable manner (PAD, p. 8).

Finally, Mongolia’s social protection system was fragmented, with numerous small cash-based benefits
raising concerns about sustainability and equity. While some programs, like the Food Stamp Program, were
targeted at the most vulnerable, the near universality of the Child Money Program highlighted issues with
the overall design of the social welfare system. Spending levels were comparable to middle- and high-
income countries, but the untargeted and fragmented nature of these programs limited their effectiveness.

Alignment with GOM reform agenda: The PDO was relevant and consistent with the government's
priorities. Throughout its delivery, the project was closely aligned with the government's PFM action plan.
Despite changes in government and the splitting of some functions from the MOF into the newly established
MED following the 2020 Parliamentary elections, the government remained committed to the project's PFM
activities. The project was also designed to support Mongolia’s Economic Recovery Plan (ERP, 2016–
2020), which called for critical PFM reforms. Beyond PFM, the project also addressed financial sector
stability and social protection, aligning with government efforts to strengthen regulatory institutions like the
BOM and the FRC. Reforms aimed at improving financial oversight and mitigating fiscal risks were key
priorities of the government, especially given the banking sector's dominance and vulnerabilities.
Additionally, the project supported social protection reforms, particularly in enhancing the effectiveness and
targeting of cash-based welfare programs, in line with government goals of improving equity and


                                                                                                     Page 6 of 22

sustainability. Despite the splitting of some MOF functions into the newly established MED after the 2020
elections, the government maintained strong commitment to the project’s multi-sector reform agenda.

Alignment with World Bank strategy: The project was well aligned with the World Bank's CPF for
Mongolia at closing (2021-2025), particularly in supporting fiscal management and strengthening
macroeconomic stability through components A, B, and D. The CPF’s focus on improving economic
governance and enhancing social protection (Focus Areas 1 and 3) was reinforced by the project’s fiscal
buffers, which proved essential in navigating the COVID-19 crisis. Post-pandemic, the CPF highlighted the
increased challenge of improving macroeconomic and monetary policies and enforcing fiscal discipline. The
CPF emphasized the need to phase out short-term relief measures and return to structural reforms. It also
noted potential risks related to financial sector stability due to weak capital buffers (Component C) and
increased vulnerability of the poor, exacerbated by COVID-19 (Component D). The project's PDO remained
aligned with CPF Focus Area 1 on Strengthening Economic Governance and Focus Area 3 on Improving
Quality of Life, particularly in social protection, while addressing broader economic goals.

Alignment with Bank and other development partner support: The project built on the achievements of
the previous Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project (MSTAP, 2010–2017, P119825), which aimed to
enhance the government’s capacity in fiscal policy, social protection, and financial sector regulation. It built
on the groundwork laid by the MSTAP by continuing essential PFM reforms and supporting the GOM's
ERP. In response to Mongolia’s fiscal challenges, multi-donor support, including the IMF’s Extended Fund
Facility (EFF) and the Bank's Second Economic Management Support Operation (EMSO, US$100 million,
2019-2020, P167485), was initiated to address fiscal deficits, rebuild reserves, and promote sustainable
growth.

This project was designed to support prior actions and conditions contained in the EMSO. EMSO1,
approved on 30 November 2017 (consisting of a US$120 million IDA grant), aimed to stabilize Mongolia’s
fiscal position by addressing deficits, rebuilding reserves, and promoting sustainable growth. While the
project was approved before EMSO1, it aligned with these goals by focusing on PFM reforms, fiscal policy
improvements, and social protection. EMSO2, (consisting of a US$20 million IBRD loan and US$80 million
IDA grant), continued these efforts, though it was delayed by a year. The project supported EMSO2’s
emphasis on fiscal discipline and structural reforms, contributing to the broader fiscal stabilization and
public financial management objectives outlined in both EMSO operations.

The project also complemented key elements of the Strengthening Governance in Mongolia project (SGM,
2019-2023, US$2.8 million, P168248), which supported development of a PFM action plan, establishment
of the FSC, and advancement of gender-responsive budgeting and PIM elements. Although the FSC was
formally established under the SGM Project, the groundwork for its eventual creation—such as reviewing
the legal framework and supporting institutional development—was carried out by the current project.

Overall assessment of Relevance: The project's relevance is rated Substantial. It aimed to address
Mongolia’s critical economic challenges, aligning with national priorities and the World Bank’s CPF. The
project’s alignment with evolving government needs and predecessor projects underscores its relevance.
However, the objectives were broad in scope, encompassing macro-fiscal management, social protection,
and financial sector regulation, weakening the project’s focus and coherence. In particular, the third
objective—improving the quality of expenditure management—was framed broadly, while the project’s
activities and outcomes related to that objective were concentrated almost exclusively on social welfare

                             OBJECTIVE 1
                             Objective
                             Strengthen fiscal stability

                             Rationale
                             A theory of change (TOC) was not a requirement at the time of project appraisal but was implicit and has
                             been developed ex-post. Broadly scoped across the entire project, the TOC sought to combine multiple,
                             disparate goals, integrating macro-fiscal management goals with sector-specific outcomes in social protection
                             and financial regulation within a single framework. Within this framework, the TOC posited, amongst other
                             things, that by developing and implementing advanced economic and revenue forecasting tools and building
                             institutional capacity, fiscal discipline would be significantly enhanced. Key activities linked to Objective 1
                             included supporting the establishment of the FSC, reviewing and updating the legal framework and
                             implementing a Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS). The projected outputs were upgraded
                             revenue forecasting models, publicly available fiscal reports and data, and enhanced budget processes.
                             These outputs, in turn, were expected to reduce aggregate expenditure deviations and ensure the effective
                             implementation of commitment controls. Ultimately, the higher-level outcomes envisioned were a stabilized
                             fiscal environment with reduced deficits and public debt, contributing to strengthened fiscal stability.

                             However, the results chain within the TOC reveals several gaps. While the TOC links activities to specific
                             outputs, such as the development of economic forecasting tools, it lacks intermediate steps that clearly
                             demonstrate how these outputs lead to broader fiscal stabilization outcomes such as reduced deficits and
                             public debt. The assumed causal relationships—such as how improved revenue models directly reduce public
                             debt—are not fully articulated, and external factors that could influence these outcomes are not accounted
                             for. Overall, while the TOC provides a broad structure that captures the project’s multi-sector goals, there are
                             missing links in the results chain, particularly in how outputs translate into higher-level outcomes.

                             Outputs

                             The indicators used to measure progress toward fiscal discipline were generally adequate, capturing key
                             elements such as revenue forecasting, debt management, and budget control. The project’s progress toward
                             improving fiscal discipline is assessed as substantial, with significant achievements across multiple key
                             areas.

      Revenue Forecasting: The project upgraded Mongolia’s revenue forecasting models, resulting in more
         accurate financial planning for both general revenues and mega-projects. A comprehensive financial
         model was developed and fully operationalized, meeting the project’s IRI for revenue forecasting (IRI,
         Achieved).
        Budget Control: To strengthen budget control and accountability, the project implemented the GFMIS
         Version 7. This upgraded system enhanced financial reporting, supported IPSAS implementation, and
         improved overall budget management. The MOF also drafted and approved a policy document on
         budget control and risk management. Additionally, a new IPS was developed, tested, and rolled out,
         which further improved budget control, accountability, and discipline. All relevant IRIs were achieved
         (related IRIs, Achieved).
        Debt Management: The project supported the development and approval of an MTDS and action
         plan (IRI, Achieved).
        Public Investment Management (PIM): A PIM Guideline for regulating the procedures and
         responsibilities of PIM project strategy/planning, appraisal, selection/prioritization, and budgeting was
         developed and endorsed by the MOF. These guidelines established standardized procedures for
         planning, appraising, selecting, and budgeting investment projects (IRI, Achieved).
        Payroll Improvements: The project also addressed inefficiencies in the payroll system and
         management information systems. The introduction of the IPS provided greater control over payroll.
         (IRI, Achieved).
        Public Outreach: Public outreach activities on proposed changes to legislation were conducted,
         exceeding the target with more than two activities completed (IRI, Achieved).

Outcomes

      PDO Indicator 1: Contain aggregate expenditure deviation to within 15 percent or less, and
         commitment controls are in place. Baseline: >15%. No commitment controls. Target: <15%.
         Commitment controls in place. Actual: <2%. Partial commitment controls. The project partly achieved
         the target.

The project centralized local budget planning into a national database, provided unified digital budget
information, and established infrastructure and procedures for commitment control, resulting in improved
budget planning and bringing expenditure deviations down to less than 2 percent. Thus, the PDO indicator for
containing aggregate expenditure deviation to within 15 percent was achieved (with baseline deviation being
greater than 15 percent).

However, the PDO-level outcome indicator of having commitment controls in place was achieved for recurrent
expenditure only. Commitment control for recurrent expenditures was launched nationwide from January
2023. For capital expenditure, which accounted for about 23 percent of total government expenditure in 2023,
commitments are only recorded but not controlled against the allotted budget, as of project closing. (PDO
Indicator 1, Partially Achieved)

      Improvements in PEFA assessment: By project closing, 12 PEFA indicators had shown progress
       since 2015, while only 3 indicators showed deterioration. The ICR notes that many of the improved
       PEFA scores were in areas supported by the project (ICR, p. 17). This outcome, although noted in the
       ICR, was not captured in the results framework.
      Improvement in OBI score: The project's contributions to system enhancements, digitalization, and
       data exchange between PFM systems supported an increase in Mongolia’s Open Budget Index (OBI)

                                                                                                    Page 9 of 22

         score from 46 to 62, indicating that the government had made more budget-related information
         publicly accessible, enhancing public oversight and greater fiscal transparency. This outcome was not
         captured in the results framework.

Overall, progress towards achievement of Objective 1 is assessed as substantial, with the achieved outcomes
demonstrating significant advancements in fiscal stability, subject to some minor shortcomings (in relation to
capital expenditures), as noted above. All IRIs were fully achieved. While the project exceeded the target for
reducing aggregate expenditure deviation, it only partially achieved the target for commitment controls,
making the overall first PDO-level indicator partially achieved.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Strengthen financial stability

Rationale
The TOC for the second objective sought to enhance financial stability by providing targeted support to key
institutions, including the MOF, BOM, FRC, the DBM, and DICOM. Key activities included improving financial
sector regulation, revising and developing financial laws, and implementing capacity-building programs for the
aforementioned financial regulatory institutions. The expected outputs were the submission of new or revised
legal acts to Parliament, a strengthened regulatory framework, and enhanced institutional capacities, all of
which were expected to contribute to enhanced financial stability.

Outputs

      BOM staff attended international Anti-Money Laundering (AML) / Combating the Financing of
         Terrorism (CFT) training and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plenary meetings. BOM developed a
         draft AML/CFT National Strategy and Action Plan.
        The project supported DBM in restructuring in 2019 and 2022 to enhance internal control, corporate
         governance, transparency, and risk management. The project also assisted DBM in developing
         methodologies for project development, credit appraisal, and risk management.
        The project assisted with preparation, submission to Parliament, and implementation of the Financial
         Sector Medium-term Development Strategy 2017-2025. Preparation and submission to Parliament of
         the Strategy was an IRI (IRI, Achieved).
        The project introduced a delivery versus payment (DvP/T+2) settlement system from March 2020 to
         meet international standards.
        The project developed a macro-prudential framework and web-based database system for the FRC,
         including training and equipment (IRI, Achieved).
        A digital payout system to manage different-sized banks and enhance DICOM effectiveness was
         designed, acquired, and implemented (IRI, Achieved)

Outcomes

      PDO Indicator 2: Regulatory framework for the financial sector improved as measured by the number
       of new or revised legal acts submitted to the Parliament. Baseline: 0. Target: 10. Actual: 10. The
       target was achieved.

The regulatory framework for the financial sector was improved as measured by the number of new or revised
legal acts submitted to Parliament. The target was to submit ten legal acts (baseline: 0), which was
successfully achieved. Ten financial sector laws were submitted to Parliament as part of the project’s
regulatory reform efforts. The following five laws had been approved at the time of the ICR: 1) Banking Law –
Approved. 2) Law on Deposits, Loans, and Payments Transactions of Banks and Authorized Legal Entities –
Approved. 3) Law on Virtual Asset Service Providers – Approved. 4) Law on Financial Consumer Protection –
Submitted (awaiting approval). 5) Law on Currency Regulation – Submitted (awaiting approval). In addition to
these, five other financial sector laws were submitted as part of the project but were not detailed in the ICR.
(ICR, p. 19).

While the PDO indicator was achieved, there were 15 outstanding laws and regulations that were not yet
approved and were either drafted or were in the process of being submitted to the Parliament at the time of
project closing. Thus, several laws and major amendments concerning the financial sector remain pending -
having either been submitted to the Parliament (and not yet approved) or pending submission. (ICR, p.
19). (PDO Indicator 2, Achieved).

      The legislative amendments contributed to Mongolia’s removal from the “grey list” of countries with
       strategic deficiencies in AML/CFT operations, indicating improved financial sector oversight.

Overall, progress toward achieving Objective 2 is rated as Modest. Despite some achievements, such as the
submission and approval of key legislative acts and the operationalization of the macro-prudential framework,
shortcomings remain. These include the incomplete implementation of critical measures like the deposit
insurance payout system and the development of a comprehensive legal framework for non-bank financial
markets (both critical activities, specified in the PAD, that were not achieved), coupled with persistent
weaknesses in regulatory and supervisory capacities. Efforts to reform the corporate governance framework
of the DBM did not fully meet international benchmarks, leading to the need for adjustments in the project's
interim result indicators for DBM. Additionally, issues with the legal and governance framework remain
outstanding, hindering the completion of key measures outlined in the PAD. The IMF's most recent Article IV
mission report (IMF, 2023) highlights ongoing weaknesses in the regulatory framework and limited
supervisory capacity for non-banking financial institutions. Furthermore, additional legal reform is necessary
to complete fully the financial sector law reform process.

Finally, a critical issue with the PDO indicator used to measure progress toward Objective 2 is that it primarily
focuses on outputs—specifically, the number of legal acts submitted to Parliament—rather than on outcomes
that reflect the actual impact or effectiveness of the legal reforms. This diminished the appropriateness of the
indicator as a measure of the objective. While the indicator was relevant, it assessed the submission of laws
rather than the broader institutional and policy changes necessary to achieve financial sector stability. By
shifting from an outcome-based measure, such as the percentage of non-performing loans (NPLs), to an
output-based measure, the assumption was made that submitting laws would automatically lead to improved
financial sector stability. However, this approach did not fully account for the actual effectiveness or quality of

sector.



Rating
Modest


OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
Improve the quality of expenditure management

Rationale
The TOC underpinning Objective 3 sought to improve the quality of expenditure through a combination of
better design, targeting and modernization of social welfare programs. Although the objective targeted
improvements in expenditure management (with no qualifiers), activities were focused solely on social
expenditure management. Key activities included developing a comprehensive database of poor households
to enhance the targeting mechanisms for social welfare program; ensuring that social welfare benefits were
aligned with actual needs through better data and targeting methods; and supporting the digitization of social
welfare services and payments, which involved transitioning from paper-based systems to digital platforms,
enabling citizens to apply for social welfare benefits online and receive payments via electronic vouchers or
digital cards. The anticipated outputs included improved social welfare policies, legal reforms for targeted
programs, and enhanced systems for identifying and supporting the poorest 20 percent of the population,
particularly through improved access to social services via digital platforms. These outputs were expected to
result in increased poverty-targeted social welfare support, leading to better-quality expenditure
management.

Outputs

      Parliament approved amendments to social insurance legislation in alignment with the State Policy on
       Pension Reform (2015-2030) (IRI, Achieved). To this end, the project supported the capacity-building
       efforts of relevant institutions, enabling them to develop, consult, and finalize the social insurance
       legislation. Formal and informal consultations, as required under the country’s Law on Legislation
       Acts, were a crucial component of this process. For example, public outreach activities were
       organized during the development of the social welfare laws, ensuring that stakeholder engagement
       and feedback were incorporated.
      The Social Insurance Package Law was first submitted to Parliament on October 15, 2021, followed
       by the Social Insurance General Law, the Law on Pensions from the Social Insurance Fund, and
       related bills on January 9, 2023. Four of the five laws were approved on July 7, 2023, with the draft
       Law on Private Pensions still pending. The revised Social Welfare Law draft, which consolidates
       existing welfare programs, has been prepared but not submitted to Parliament by the time of project
       closing (IRI, Not Achieved).
      Improvements were realized in the design, targeting, operations, and performance of the food stamp
       program. The eligibility criteria for the food stamp program were better defined to ensure more
       accurate targeting. The project facilitated the transition from a paper-based to an electronic food
       voucher system (digital cards).

                                  In total, 64 social welfare services were brought online, enabling citizens to apply online. Digital
                                   payments were implemented for the distribution of social assistance benefits, streamlining processes.

                            Outcomes

                                  PDO Indicator 3. Aggregate poverty-targeted social welfare support going to the poorest 20 percent
                                   is increased. Baseline: Food Stamp Program is the only poverty targeted social welfare benefit with a
                                   total budget of MNT17 billion. End Target: Aggregate amount of poverty targeted social welfare
                                   benefits (including the FSP and other/s) going to the poorest 20% is increased by 50 percent to
                                   MNT22.5 billion. The project achieved 100 percent more than its target.
                                  The aggregate poverty-targeted social welfare support going to the poorest 20 percent increased from
                                   a baseline of MNT17 billion to MNT47 billion in 2023, surpassing the end target of MNT22.5 billion
                                   (PDO Indicator, Achieved).
                                  Improved Social Welfare Operations: The efficiency and accessibility of social welfare services
                                   improved through the introduction of digital tools and online service delivery. The digitization of social
                                   welfare administration has led to significant cost savings, including MNT52.1 million from reduced
                                   printing expenses and MNT197.5 million from lower commercial bank fees in 2022. Digitization has
                                   also minimized the need for social welfare recipients to visit physical locations to submit forms and
                                   eliminated costs associated with producing paper-based food stamps, which have now been replaced
                                   by digital cards (ICR, p. 52).

                            Overall, the project’s achievements under Objective 3 can be assessed as Substantial, subject to some
                            caveats. Improvements in the targeting and delivery of social welfare benefits, particularly the doubling of
                            poverty-targeted social assistance, indicate a meaningful enhancement in the effectiveness of social
                            protection. The successful digitization of services and payments has modernized the social welfare system,
                            making it more accessible and efficient. Given the focus on consolidating fragmented welfare programs, the
                            social insurance law amendments have been timely and necessary. Strengthening the legal framework was
                            essential for providing a stronger foundation for better social welfare policy implementation, particularly in
                            addressing gaps in social protection coverage. However, although the project supported the drafting of
                            amendments to the Social Welfare Law aimed at consolidating existing social welfare programs, these
                            amendments were not submitted to Parliament by the time of the project’s closing. Thus, some legal reforms
                            in the social welfare system were left incomplete. Furthermore, the project focused solely on social welfare
                            expenditure, while the objective called for improvement in the quality of expenditure management more
                            generally.

  significant progress in most of its key areas, particularly in enhancing fiscal stability and improving the quality
  of social welfare systems. While there were some limitations in fully realizing all the planned reforms,
  particularly under Objective 2, the overall impact of the project remains strong, with substantial advancements
  in two out of the three primary objectives detailed in the PAD, alongside additional outcomes that emerged
  during project restructuring. Beyond meeting its initial objectives, the project exceeded expectations by
  developing and implementing the Integrated Payroll System and the Intermediate Service Platform, which
  were not part of the original plan.

 5. Efficiency
The PAD and ICR state that no standard economic rate of return (ERR) or formal financial analysis was
conducted for the project. This decision was based on the nature of the project, which focused on institutional
capacity-building and human resource development across entities such as the MOF, MLSP, and the Central
Bank. As noted in the PAD, the project was not amenable to traditional financial analysis due to the limited
opportunities for cost recovery within these government institutions (PAD, p. 31). However, both the PAD and
ICR acknowledged the potential for fiscal savings through improved budgeting, expenditure management, and
public investment efficiency.

Overall, project initiatives contributed to the enhanced efficiency and adaptability of Mongolia's financial
management systems. The project facilitated a strategic shift from reliance on the FreeBalance suite—a more
traditional, monolithic system approach—to a modular strategy that allowed for more flexible, locally developed
solutions. The Intermediate Service Platform further facilitated the integration and sharing of data across
different financial management modules, improving overall system functionality. The project’s enhancements to
budget preparation and execution systems, including the development of the FISCAL budget system and the
PIMIS, as well as the digitization of social welfare service delivery, significantly streamlined government
budgeting, accounting, and reporting processes.

Another notable efficiency gain was in training delivery. By moving from a fully face-to-face training model to a
blended learning approach that combined online and in-person training, the project achieved a significant
reduction in training costs. Specifically, the average cost of training per person dropped by 68 percent in 2021
and by 44 percent in 2022. Even after some face-to-face training elements were reintroduced in 2023, the
overall per-person cost remained around 50 percent lower than the 2020 baseline, without compromising the
quality of training.

Several other elements further enhanced the efficiency of implementation. For example, the introduction of the
MOF’s internal performance management system (Leader Monitoring) was a critical element in advancing
reforms, particularly in PFM. This system incentivized progress by embedding the PFM action plan within the
MOF’s internal performance framework, creating ownership and ensuring sustained momentum throughout the
project. The system also helped align the project’s Components A and B with broader reform efforts under the
MOF (ICR, p. 26).

Furthermore, the complementarity between this and other concurrent initiatives, such as the SGM project,
enhanced the overall effectiveness and coordination of interventions. These two projects worked in tandem,
allowing for the continuation and reinforcement of critical reforms, such as the rollout of gender-responsive
budgeting pilots and the implementation of international agreements on taxation (e.g., Base Erosion and Profit
Sharing – BEPS). This coordination contributed to the success of both projects by preventing duplication and
ensuring a more coherent approach to reforms (ICR, p. 26). In this context, strong working relationships
between the Bank and key counterparts, including the MOF, BOM, and MLSP, also played a vital role (ICR, p.
29).

However, there were some efficiency challenges, particularly due to unclear institutional roles and
responsibilities following the establishment of MED. This institutional change created some ambiguity in
responsibilities, especially concerning PIM functions that had been primarily developed under the MOF.
Although the project saw notable success in building PIM capacity, the realignment of institutional
responsibilities caused delays and uncertainty, requiring further clarification from the government (ICR, pp. 30,
31).

In conclusion, the overall efficiency of the project is rated modest due to the limited evidence of efficiency gains
in areas beyond PFM. While the project demonstrated notable efficiencies through the digitization of budgetary
processes, social welfare administration, and payroll systems—leading to cost savings in these areas—there is
insufficient evidence to support similar efficiency gains in the broader objectives of the project, such as social
welfare reform and financial sector strengthening.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The project faces several risks that may impact its sustainability and long-term success. Economic risks,
particularly the potential for increased global inflation following the COVID-19 pandemic, could undermine
Mongolia’s financial and economic stability. Global geopolitical tensions further exacerbate these risks. On
the institutional and technical side, while the project successfully introduced technology-based information
systems, their sustainability depends on regular maintenance, security updates, and continuous monitoring.
Ensuring that these systems remain functional requires the implementing agency to prioritize human
resources, structure, and skills. However, if technological support for these systems is reduced or halted,
further development and improvement may be jeopardized, potentially limiting the sustainability of the
project’s outcomes.

Political risks also pose a threat to the project’s sustainability. Future government resolutions and decisions
could affect the use, scope, and purpose of the project’s outputs. Key reforms in social protection, public
investment, and budgeting processes, which were advanced through the project, require ongoing Cabinet
support. Any changes in political leadership or shifts in government priorities could delay or derail the
implementation of these reforms. Additionally, unresolved institutional ambiguities—such as those introduced
by the creation of the MED, which complicated roles and responsibilities related to PIM—remain a concern.
While the Bank has advised the GOM on clarifying these roles and is preparing further guidance, governance
concerns persist, particularly regarding financial sector supervision and the independence of institutions like
DICOM.

Despite these challenges, the enhanced PFM systems and tools introduced by the project are likely equip
the government to better manage these risks, having provided a solid foundation for continued reform and
improvement. A new draft PFM action plan for 2023-27 was developed, building on this project's foundations
and the complementary SGM project. This new plan emphasizes enhancing policy linkages to the budget
and incorporating performance management in budget planning and execution to improve service delivery
efficiency. The success of this project in fostering strong dialogue between the Bank and the MOF ensured
close consultation during the draft PFM plan's preparation.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The Bank had a track record of supporting similar multisectoral operations, such as the MSTAP (2010-
  2017, US$12 million, P119825), which helped establish and maintain a trusted relationship with key
  counterparts for this project, including the MOF, BOM, and MLSP. Accordingly, the design of this lending
  operation was informed by lessons from these previous initiatives, drawing specifically on experiences
  from the MSTAP (collected in the Implementation Status and Result Report from December 2016) and
  the Mongolia Development Policy Credit Operation (2008–2009), as well as insights from the

  Performance and Learning Review (PLR) of the country’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the
  Period FY 2013-2017. (PAD, p. 26).

  The Bank identified, facilitated preparation of, and appraised the operation to maximize the likelihood of
  achieving the planned development outcomes. This operation was strategically important to the
  government, considering the context of the Bank’s CPF and EMSO operations, as well as the
  government’s ERP and the IMF’s EFF. The operation reflected careful consideration of technical,
  political, and institutional factors.

  Despite these strengths, the project faced challenges related to its complexity. The TOC aimed to
  address Mongolia’s fiscal stability, financial sector stability, and expenditure management. However, it
  was too broad, merging macro-fiscal management goals with sector-specific outcomes in social
  protection and financial regulation. This design complexity diluted focus, making it difficult to establish
  clear pathways from activities to measurable outcomes, and ultimately affecting full achievement of the
  second objective. Furthermore, there was misalignment between the broadly worded third objective and
  its set of interventions focused exclusively on social protection expenditure. While the results framework
  was well conceived, a more focused set of objectives and TOC would have better aligned activities with
  outcomes.



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 The Bank proactively addressed and resolved issues that could have impeded achievement of the project's
 development outcomes. Strong relationships between government counterparts and Bank task team
 leaders, component leads, subject matter specialists, and expert consultants facilitated effective
 implementation support and project restructurings. Implementation Status and Results Reports and Aide
 Memoires thoroughly documented the project's activities, challenges, and successes.

 Although the project’s complexity presented challenges. (due to the need to revise the PDO indicator under
 the second objective, shifting from NPLs to the number of financial laws submitted to Parliament), the Bank
 task team closely supervised implementation, leveraging a strong in-country presence. With a TTL and all
 component leaders based in the Bank's country office, the team maintained close engagement and
 effective supervision. Local oversight was bolstered by international expertise as needed, especially for
 Components A and B, supported by the SGM Project (ICR, p. 26, para [60]). Low Task Team Leader
 turnover helped to maintain continuity and fostering a hands-on supervisory approach, and allowed the
 team to adapt project activities in response to performance outcomes and emerging challenges (ICR, p.
 25).

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The project’s M&E framework was well-designed in relation to Objective 1. Additionally, the 2021 PEFA
 assessment, funded by the SGM project, provided a valuable benchmark for progress in PFM reforms
 supported by this project. It used the baseline data from the 2015 PEFA assessment to evaluate progress
 and identified areas needing further strengthening, such as budget performance, oversight of state-owned
 enterprises, and adoption of international accounting standards.

 However, the project’s M&E framework had some notable shortcomings, particularly in relation to
 Objectives 2 and 3. The original PDO indicator for PDO 2, based on the percentage of NPLs, proved
 problematic as it was impacted by macroeconomic factors beyond the project’s control. For example,
 economic downturns, external shocks, or changes in market conditions could lead to fluctuations in NPL
 levels, regardless of the project’s interventions, making it an unreliable measure of progress. It was
 replaced by an indicator measuring the submission of financial sector laws to Parliament, which did not
 capture the quality of impact of submitted laws, should those laws be passed.

 For PDO Indicator 3, while the project surpassed its target for increasing poverty-targeted social welfare
 support by 108.9%, this large deviation suggests that the target-setting process may have been
 insufficiently ambitious. The target of MNT22.5 billion was met just a few days after the project became
 effective (according to ISR#3 in September 2017). This indicates that the target might not have been based
 on robust evidence or a realistic assessment of the project's potential impact.

 Overall, the absence of well-aligned indicators for these two Objectives limited the framework’s capacity to
 fully measure and capture progress in key areas. This gap reduced the ability to assess whether the
 project’s broader goals, particularly in financial sector stability and social welfare, were being achieved.



b. M&E Implementation
  M&E data were collected and analyzed using a methodologically sound approach. The selected data
  sources and methodology facilitated robust measurement of the indicators. The Project Implementation
  Unit (PIU) effectively managed and coordinated data collection efforts. Progress was systematically
  measured and reported in the Bank’s Implementation Status and Results Reports. The PIU prepared
  semi-annual and annual monitoring and evaluation reports, along with monthly, quarterly, and annual
  project implementation reports. The continuity of the PIU from the prior MSTAP took advantage
  of established networks and facilitated efficient data collection. The ICR noted that the collected M&E
  data were reliable and of high quality (ICR, p. 27).



c. M&E Utilization

                                                                                                  Page 18 of 22

     SFFSP (P161048)



  Both the Client and the Bank task team systematically used the collected data to monitor project
  progress and guide project restructuring. Each year, an annual work plan was developed based on
  measured progress against PDO and intermediate result indicators. However, significant shortcomings
  in the M&E design—particularly the lack of well-aligned, outcome-focused indicators—are likely to have
  limited the effectiveness of these efforts, making it more difficult to accurately track the project’s impact
  in certain areas, such as financial sector stability and social welfare reform. Although post-project
  closure, authorities continue to collect data and have institutionalized many M&E practices, including
  integrating PFM reform activities into the Ministry of Finance’s internal performance management
  system, the overall M&E design limitations during the project’s implementation phase impacted the full
  potential of its utilization.

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The project was classified as Category C, indicating minimal or no adverse environmental impacts,
   according to the environmental assessment. The integration of gender-responsive budgeting activities
   highlighted a focus on equality in fiscal decision-making. Additionally, support was given to the FRC to
   develop regulations for green financial products and services, informed by research on green financing
   markets. A project-specific Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) was designed and implemented in 2021,
   with a training consultant from the PIU overseeing its operation. An instructional note on using the GRM
   was developed and made available on the project website. During the implementation period, no complaints
   or inquiries were received.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   The project's financial management adhered to the arrangements outlined in the Legal Agreement and met
   the Bank's financial reporting requirements promptly. Although there were periods of uneven
   implementation and disbursements across different technical components, measures were taken to
   address these issues. Notably, efforts to accelerate implementation of Component C, including acquiring
   the digital payout system of DICOM, helped align spending more closely with the planned budget for that
   component, which had been lagging. Additionally, the project restructuring in 2021 involved reallocating
   funds from Components A, C, and D to Component B.

   The procurement plan primarily involved low-value, low-risk contracts for individual consultants, some
   shopping for goods, and consulting firm contracts awarded based on consultants' qualifications.
   Throughout the project, a total of 485 contracts were signed, with 79 percent allocated to consultancies
   and 21 percent to goods and non-consulting services. The mid-term review highlighted extensive use of
   direct selection for individual consultancy contracts, often justified by the short-term nature of assignments,
   though these contracts frequently extended beyond their initial terms. The Implementation Status and
   Results Report from March 2023 confirmed that risks associated with low-value contracts were minimal

12. Lessons

IEG agrees with the lessons outlined in the ICR (pp. 31-32). It highlights that a well-conceived
results framework is critical for ensuring the success of a project. It provides a clear
structure for monitoring progress by identifying outcomes, outputs, and corresponding
targets and indicators. The project’s experience highlights the importance of aligning the TOC
closely with the PDO and avoiding unifying overly broad or disparate goals under a single
framework. A well-defined TOC should connect activities to specific, measurable outcomes,
ensuring cohesive progress toward the PDO. While the TOC aimed to address Mongolia's economic
challenges by enhancing fiscal stability, financial sector stability, and social welfare expenditure
management, it became too broad and convoluted. The TOC tried to merge macro-fiscal
management goals with sector-specific outcomes in social protection and financial regulation,
complicating the creation of clear pathways from activities to outcomes. This broad approach risked
diluting focus and impact, requiring management of multiple, disparate components within a single
framework. The TOC’s complexity, coupled with critical assumptions such as ongoing political
support, stable macroeconomic conditions, and sufficient implementing agency capacity, made it
challenging to maintain a clear connection between activities and outcomes. Future projects should

aim for a more focused TOC that aligns closely with the PDO and includes well-articulated pathways
to enhance coherence and effectiveness. Ideally, future projects should combine both output and
outcome measures in M&E frameworks to better capture the complex interplay of internal and
external influences on fiscal stability.

IEG adds the following lesson: Effective capacity building and training are essential for the
successful implementation and sustainability of development projects. The project supported
the delivery of 336 training events to nearly 38,000 participants, and thereby significantly
strengthened institutional capabilities. The adoption of virtual training tools during the COVID-19
pandemic not only ensured continuity but also increased reach and efficiency. Continuous
monitoring and evaluation, as demonstrated by the survey showing 92 percent of participants
reporting improved work performance, underscore the importance of well-designed and adaptable
training programs.

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR was well-structured, offering a clear overview of the project’s key objectives and achievements. It
effectively outlined the project's goals and demonstrated how they aligned with the government’s ERP and the
associated development partner funding, including the Bank’s EMSO and the IMF’s EFF. By connecting the
project’s themes with the ERP and external support programs, the report underscored the strong degree of
government ownership during the project’s inception. Additionally, the ICR provided useful context by
discussing predecessor projects, which helped to frame the current project within a broader development
trajectory.

The ICR also offered valuable lessons for future reform projects, particularly emphasizing the importance of
well-defined and properly scoped project objectives, as well as well-articulated TOCs to ensure that project
goals are realistically aligned with broader development objectives.

The ICR’s overall quality could have been strengthened by documenting the rationale for not conducting a split
evaluation, especially given changes to PDO-level indicators during implementation. Including this analysis
would have allowed for a more nuanced assessment of the project’s achievements against both its original and
revised indicators.
