2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   According to p. 5 of the Financing Agreement, the project development objective (PDO) was to "provide poor
   communities and households with greater access to basic socio-economic infrastructure and social safety
   nets." The PDO was revised at a June 2021 additional financing to "provide poor communities and
   households with greater access to basic socio-economic infrastructure, social safety nets, and economic
   inclusion opportunities," For the purposes of this ICR Review, the original PDO is defined as: (i) provide poor
   communities and households with greater access to basic socio-economic infrastructure; and (ii) provide poor


                                                                                                   Page 1 of 21

   communities and households with social safety nets. A third PDO is added at the additional financing: (iii)
   provide poor communities and households with economic inclusion opportunities.

   A March 2020 restructuring adjusted outcome indicators for the first objective; however, the application of a
   split rating is not justified in this context, as the revisions were informed by the identification of socio-economic
   infrastructure needs by participating communities through a community-driven development (CDD) approach,
   the details of which were not foreseeable at the appraisal stage. The revisions to outcome indicators adjusted
   expected outcomes to the specifics of the infrastructure investments as they were determined, rather than
   raising or lowering the ambition of those outcomes in the aggregate.

   However, given that the PDO statement was expanded to include a third objective, the split rating
   methodology will be employed to evaluate separately the original PDO, which consists of two objectives, and
   the revised PDO, comprising three objectives.

d. Components
   Component 1: Infrastructure Sub-Projects (estimated cost at appraisal: US$8.4 million; revised cost:
   US$8.4 million; actual cost: US$8.02 million)

   The component was to support the rehabilitation and construction of vital infrastructure within selected
   communities across five regions. The scope was to encompass: (i) the enhancement of educational
   facilities through the establishment and refurbishment of primary schools and literacy centers; (ii) the
   development of healthcare infrastructure, including primary care centers and community pharmacies; (iii)
   the installation and improvement of water points and water retention systems; (iv) the repair and
   construction of secondary roads; and (v) the construction and renovation of market infrastructure.
   Additionally, the sub-projects were to comprise not only the physical infrastructure but also the necessary
   support to ensure functionality and service quality, such as providing school furniture, health equipment,
   and supplies, among other essentials. Cantons were to be prioritized according to their poverty levels,
   followed by workshops that facilitated the identification of beneficiary villages through a random selection
   process. This approach resulted in the selection of 200 villages, which were apportioned across regions in
   proportion to their contribution to national poverty levels. After village selection, the CDD approach was
   adopted to actively engage the community in the identification and planning of infrastructure projects.

Component 2: Social Safety Nets (estimated cost at appraisal: US$15.0 million; revised cost: US$32
million; actual cost: US$28.04 million)

The component was to support enhanced access to social safety nets for the poorest and most vulnerable
households in Togo, with an initial focus on two subcomponents, school feeding and cash transfers, with a
third subcomponent on economic inclusion measures introduced subsequently (details follow).

i. School Feeding: This subcomponent was integral to the school feeding program over two academic
years. It was characterized by a CDD approach, with local women playing a crucial role in meal preparation
and distribution. The initiative was to support local economies by sourcing all food items from nearby
markets, which would also ensure the provision of fresh and culturally appropriate meals for the
students. The primary beneficiaries were students in primary schools located within economically
disadvantaged geographic regions.

ii. Cash Transfers: Aimed at enhancing income and consumption for selected households, this
subcomponent was to employ a strategic two-step allocation process. Initially, resources were to be
distributed among regions based on poverty levels, followed by community selection using an index that
measured access to socio-economic infrastructure. Within these communities, households were to be
identified through a combination of community recommendations and a proxy means test (PMT) survey.
Eligible beneficiaries were to receive six quarterly payments of 15,000 FCFA each over an 18-month period,
amounting to approximately 22 percent of the national poverty threshold.

Component 3: Capacity Building and Project Management (estimated cost at appraisal: US$5.0
million; revised cost: US$8.6 million; actual cost US$12.76 million)

The component was organized into three subcomponents aimed at strengthening grassroots management,
supporting safety net systems, and supporting robust project management:

i. Grassroots Management Training (GMT): This subcomponent was to deliver a comprehensive GMT
package to beneficiary communities, focusing on essential skills such as information and communication,
community organization, poverty and needs assessment, participatory planning, procurement, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation, and maintenance, thereby equipping communities with the tools
for effective self-governance.

ii. Support for Safety Net Systems: This subcomponent was dedicated to (i) creating and implementing a
system for the identification and support of poor and vulnerable households, (ii) managing a grievance
redress mechanism (GRM) to resolve project-related issues efficiently, and (iii) fortifying the recipient's
social protection system to provide better services to those in need.

iii. Project Management: This subcomponent was to finance the implementation costs of the project,
encompassing staff-related expenses, equipment, vehicles, fuel, and office space at national and regional
levels. It was also to cover communication and operational costs associated with procurement, supervision,
auditing, and evaluation of project activities, ensuring comprehensive and effective management of the
project.

  The Additional Financing dated June 23, 2021: (i) expanded the cash transfer programs to include a
  broader range of recipients in both rural and urban areas; (ii) launched economic inclusion initiatives to
  support broader participation in the economy; and (iii) provided continuous technical assistance to the
  government to reinforce the country's social protection framework. The project's components and financial
  allocations were consequently amended to accommodate the broadened scope of cash transfers, the
  integration of economic inclusion initiatives, and the strengthening of the country's social protection system.
  Component 2 was revised from Social Safety Nets to Productive Social Safety Nets. Economic inclusion
  activities were to comprise a three-pronged approach:

        Entrepreneurship Training: Equipping households with business management and planning skills
         to improve their ability to generate income.
        Mentorship and Market Access: Providing guidance and support from the National Community
         Development Support Agency (Agence Nationale d'Appui au Développement à la Base,
         ANADEB) local agents to develop and implement business plans, along with enhancing market
         access and skills.
        Productive Grant: Offering a 100,000 FCFA (approximately US$180) grant per household,
         distributed through the Novissi platform, to encourage the growth of income-generating activities.

  The targeting of beneficiaries of productive social safety nets was supported by Togo's unified social
  registry developed in 2017, which includes key building blocks such as a methodology for targeting the
  poorest households (a PMT questionnaire and formula).



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  Project Cost. The parent project was approved for US$29 million, and the June 2021 additional financing
  was approved for US$20 million, for a combined total cost of US$49 million. Actual disbursement amounted
  to US$48.43 million, with the grant and credit portions amounting to US$39.51 million and US$8.9 million,
  respectively. The difference between the approved amount and the actual disbursement was explained by
  fluctuations between Special Drawing Rights against the Euro and the U.S. dollar currencies, as well as an
  undisbursed amount of US$11,000.

  Financing. The parent project was financed by an International Development Association (IDA)
  grant amounting to US$29 million (IDA-D1740). The Additional Financing was financed through a
  combination of an IDA grant amounting to US$10 million (IDA-D8650) and a credit of US$10 million (IDA-
  69470).

  Dates. The project was approved on March 21, 2017, and became effective on November 30, 2017. A mid-
  term review was held on June 7, 2019. The project closed on December 31, 2023, three years later than the
  original closing date of December 31, 2020. The project underwent three project restructurings and one
  additional financing as follows:

        The first restructuring, dated November 29, 2017, amended the Financing Agreement to convert
         the recruitment of safeguards specialists to a dated covenant due three months after project
         effectiveness, allowing enough time for the Recipient to conclude the ongoing recruitment process.
        The second restructuring, dated March 9, 2020, made changes to the results framework following
         the identification of community priorities in the 200 targeted communities, made changes to the


                                                                                                    Page 4 of 21

          implementation schedule to allow more time to deliver project results, and extended the loan closing
          date from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021.
         The additional financing, dated June 23, 2021, assisted the government in achieving its goals to
          mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and to enhance its capacity for shock-responsive
          social protection. The results framework was revised to reflect the project's expanded reach and the
          inclusion of new activities. The original IDA grant's project closure date was postponed from
          December 31, 2021, to June 30, 2023, aligning it with the additional financing's closure date.
         The third restructuring, dated March 25, 2023, made changes to the results framework and to the
          implementation schedule, and extended the loan closing date from June 30, 2023, to December 31,
          2023, for the additional financing (P176460, IDA Grant No. D8650 and IDA Credit No.69470).




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
The objectives were highly relevant to Togo's socio-economic context and development priorities. At the
time of appraisal, Togo faced significant challenges related to poverty, inequality, and inadequate access to
basic services. The project was designed to support the government's efforts to reduce poverty and
promote inclusive growth. By improving access to education, health services, water and sanitation, road
infrastructure and markets, the project aimed to address critical gaps in basic services that were essential
for socio-economic development. Additionally, the provision of social safety nets, food aid, and economic
inclusion opportunities was intended to enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations and reduce their
dependence on external aid. The relevance of the project objectives can be assessed through
their alignment with national development goals and World Bank strategies:

Alignment with National Development Goals. The project's focus on improving socio-economic
infrastructure and providing social safety nets was well aligned with the country's development strategies.
The Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy (Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de
Promotion de l’Emploi) covering the 2013-2017 period emphasized the importance of developing human
capital, social protection, and jobs, calling for increased construction of schools, water points, and other
basic services infrastructure, as well as increased coverage of school feeding and cash transfer programs
for the poor and vulnerable. The National Development Plan (Plan national de développement) for Togo for
the period 2018-2022 aimed to increase access to basic services with the objective of reducing poverty by
making improved service delivery at the local level a top priority to promote basic social and infrastructure
services and improve their quality.

Consistency with World Bank Strategies. The World Bank's Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for
Togo for the period FY17-FY20 responded directly to the country's priorities and proposed support for the
government's efforts of scaling up social services, strengthening health systems, and empowering local
governments and communities. It made improving service delivery at the local level a top priority to promote
basic social and infrastructure services and improve their quality. The CPF emphasized the importance of
economic and social inclusion, and the project directly contributed to this focus area by targeting the
poorest communities and households. The CPF's Performance and Learning Review extended the original
CPF period by two years to FY22. The subsequent CPF, spanning FY25-FY29, articulates goals that
emphasize the enhancement of infrastructure alongside the fortification of social safety nets, acknowledging

                                      TG-Safety Nets & Basic Services Project (P157038)



               the synergy between these domains as pivotal for realizing sustainable and inclusive growth. Notably, there
               was an absence of an interim strategy note between the CPFs for FY17-FY22 and FY25-FY29.

               In addition to meeting the urgent needs of impoverished households and communities, the project aimed to
               enhance the efficiency of Togo’s social protection system by tackling issues related to its fragmentation,
               although this was not one of the stated objectives.

               The additional financing aimed to address immediate relief and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as
               well as long-term social protection challenges by expanding cash transfers to the poorest and most
               vulnerable in both rural and urban settings, introducing economic inclusion initiatives to aid economic
               recovery and provide a path to higher earnings and resilience, and offering technical assistance to enhance
               the country's social protection system. The additional financing combined cash transfers with economic
               inclusion to tackle the complex challenges households face, also bolstering resilience against various
               shocks, including those from climate change.

               In conclusion, the objectives of the Safety Nets and Basic Services Project were highly relevant to Togo's
               development context and aligned with both national and international development strategies. The project's
               focus on improving access to basic services, providing social safety nets, and enhancing economic
               inclusion opportunities addressed critical socio-economic needs and contributed to long-term development
               goals.

                             OBJECTIVE 1
                             Objective
                             Provide poor communities and households with greater access to basic socio-economic infrastructure

                             Rationale
                             The theory of change for this objective posited that rehabilitating and constructing essential infrastructure in
                             poor communities through a CDD approach, coupled with operational support, would result in improved
                             community basic infrastructure and enhanced access to basic socio-economic infrastructure. By empowering
                             communities to decide which infrastructure sub-projects required rehabilitation or construction, the project
                             allowed improvements to be targeted towards areas with the most pressing needs and where improved
                             access was crucial. The targeting of communities was effectively executed by combining geographic targeting
                             with household targeting through a PMT and a community-driven approach to exclude non-poor households
                             in selected geographies. The distribution of the 200 selected communities across the five regions was as
                             follows: 24 in the Maritime region, 41 in Plateaux, 34 in Centrale, 44 in Kara and 57 in Savanes. The CDD

approach was subsequently implemented for communities to identify and plan infrastructure sub-projects in
nine phases, from initial information and sensitization to community self-evaluation.

Outputs and Intermediate Outcomes

      Infrastructure Rehabilitation/Construction: 200 micro-infrastructure projects, selected through
         community validation, were completed under the project, meeting the target of 200 projects. There
         was one micro-infrastructure project completed per community. The infrastructure sub-projects
         comprised of community centers (19), solar-powered boreholes (69), school buildings (84), primary
         healthcare facilities (10), market sheds (6), rural roads (10), and water reservoirs (2). In addition to the
         stand-alone boreholes, the 19 community centers and the 10 primary healthcare facilities also
         included boreholes as part of the overall infrastructure, leading to a total of 98 boreholes (69+19). With
         three drinking fountains connected to each borehole, a total of 294 drinking fountains were
         established.
        Classroom Construction/Rehabilitation: 252 additional classrooms were built or rehabilitated at the
         primary level resulting from project interventions. The project team clarified that this indicator
         measured the number of classrooms constructed or rehabilitated with funding from the project as part
         of the infrastructure sub-projects under Component 1, and it is assumed that the
         construction/rehabilitation of classrooms responded to a perceived shortfall/need. This achievement
         fell short of the original target of 300 but surpassed the revised target of 228 classrooms.
        Health Facility Construction/Renovation: 10 health facilities were constructed, renovated, and/or
         equipped. This achievement fell short of the original and the revised targets of 20 and 31 facilities,
         respectively.
        Improved Community Water Points Construction/Rehabilitation: 69 improved community water
         points were constructed or rehabilitated, surpassing the original and revised targets of 40 and 53,
         respectively.
        Technical Quality: Ninety-five (95) percent of basic socio-economic infrastructure was assessed as
         having satisfactory technical quality. This achievement surpassed the target of 80 percent.
        Grassroots Management Training (GMT): 200 communities received GMT, exceeding the target of
         100 communities.

Outcomes

      School Enrollment: 13,030 students were enrolled in rehabilitated or constructed schools under the
       project. This achievement fell short of the original target of 15,000 but surpassed the revised target of
       11,400 students.
      Access to Improved Water Sources: 55,884 individuals in rural areas were provided with access to
       improved water sources. This achievement surpassed the original and the revised targets of 32,000
       and 13,250 individuals.
      Infrastructure Functionality: Ninety-six (96) percent of community infrastructure was functioning one
       year after completion. This achievement surpassed the target of 80 percent.

The results framework approved during the preparation process did not include outcome indicators related to
the use of socio-economic infrastructure pertaining to health facilities, road infrastructure, or markets.
Consequently, these indicators were not systematically collected. However, the Bank later clarified that the
project provided access to community health centers for 64,823 individuals and access to other types of
infrastructure sub-projects (i.e., rural roads, community centers, market sheds, water reservoirs) to 61,823

individuals. The project's final evaluation also included a series of questions to beneficiaries about the
usefulness and effective use of the infrastructure sub-projects. The evaluation results indicated that 91.6
percent of respondents (230 in total, including 172 cash transfer beneficiaries and 58 non-beneficiaries)
confirmed that the chosen sub-projects addressed the community’s needs. Additionally, 79 percent of cash
transfer beneficiaries and 72.4 percent of non-beneficiaries reported that at least one member of their
households actively uses the infrastructure. The Bank also clarified that the project provided GMT to 37,755
individuals.

Overall

While the project achieved significant success in areas such as classroom construction, water access, and
infrastructure functionality, it fell short in health facility construction and renovation. Given the demand-driven
nature of the sub-projects, it is not surprising that targets were exceeded in some areas and not met in others.
Overall, the end-of-project evaluation indicated that the chosen sub-projects addressed the community’s
needs, meeting overall targets. Therefore, the project's overall objective of providing poor communities and
households with greater access to basic socio-economic infrastructure was substantially met.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Provide poor communities and households with social safety nets

Rationale
The theory of change for this objective posited that providing social safety nets to vulnerable households, in
the form of cash transfer programs and food aid through a well-structured targeting mechanism, would
achieve the objective of providing poor communities and households with social safety nets.

For the targeting of cash transfers in rural areas, the project used existing poverty maps to identify the most
impoverished cantons, initially employing a map from the National Statistics Agency and subsequently one
created by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley (for the Additional Financing). Within these
selected cantons, a public lottery facilitated the random selection of villages. In these villages, a PMT survey
was conducted to pinpoint the poorest households. To validate the findings of the PMT survey, a community
validation process was implemented, ensuring that the results were consistent with realities as perceived by
the local inhabitants. This represented a superior targeting methodology to the one employed under previous
projects, namely, PDC (Community Development Project, Projet de Développement Communautaire)
(P127200) and PDCplus (Community Development and Safety Nets Project, Projet de Développement
Communautaire et de Filets Sociaux Plus) (P144484), which were limited to geographic targeting.

For the targeting of cash transfers in the Greater Lomé area as part of the Additional Financing, a multi-
staged approach was implemented to effectively identify the poorest neighborhoods. Due to limited resources
that prevented comprehensive coverage of all neighborhoods and the lack of an existing poverty map for
Lomé, a new methodology was developed in collaboration with colleagues from the Poverty Global Practice.
This involved creating an index that combined various geospatial indicators, including population density,

                                                                                                     Page 8 of 21

nighttime light (as a proxy for economic activity), access to schools and health centers, road density, and
flood risks. Using shapefiles from the national statistics agency, the project generated a map ranking Greater
Lomé's neighborhoods based on a composite socioeconomic measure. In the second phase, following an
extensive communication campaign, households were invited to self-register as potential beneficiaries at
designated temporary registration sites. This self-registration process served as a secondary filter, as non-
poor households typically avoided the transaction costs associated with registration. In the third phase, self-
registered households underwent a survey using a simplified PMT questionnaire, based on the SWIFT
methodology developed by the Poverty Global Practice. This survey aimed to rank households according to
their socioeconomic status. Finally, lists of the identified beneficiaries were posted in neighborhoods, allowing
community members the opportunity to validate the targeting process and ensure its alignment with local
perceptions of poverty.

For the targeting of food aid, a five-stage approach was implemented as follows: (i) the total number of
students to be included in the program was determined based on available resources from both IDA and the
government; (ii) the determined number of students was then distributed across different regions, taking into
account each region's contribution to national poverty levels; (iii) the poorest cantons were identified using the
2011 poverty map to ensure that the most disadvantaged areas were prioritized; (iv) schools were randomly
selected from all eligible cantons, with schools in the poorest cantons that had already benefited from
canteens under previous projects (PDC and PDCplus) being excluded from this selection to avoid
redundancy; and (v) eligible schools were allocated between the two sources of funding, IDA and the
government, to ensure a balanced and efficient use of resources.

Outputs and intermediate outcomes

      School Feeding Program:
           o 161 schools benefitted from the school feeding program. This achievement met the target of
               160 schools.
            o 15,043,260 meals were provided to students in schools targeted for the school feeding
               program. This achievement surpassed the target of 13,000,000 meals.
            o Ninety (90) percent of schools benefiting from the school feeding program were located in the
               poorest 20 percent of cantons in their region. This achievement met the target of 90 percent of
               schools.
      Cash Transfers:
            o Eighty (80) percent of cash transfer beneficiaries were in the bottom two quintiles of
               the national consumption distribution. This achievement met the target of 80 percent.
            o One hundred (100) percent of cash transfer payments were received within five days of the
               scheduled date. This achievement surpassed the target of 80 percent.
            o 94.35 percent of beneficiaries reported being satisfied with the cash transfer intervention. This
               achievement surpassed the target of 70 percent.
            o 95.17 percent of female beneficiaries reported being satisfied with the cash
               transfer intervention. This achievement surpassed the target of 70 percent.
            o 57 percent of cash transfer beneficiaries were in climate-affected regions. This achievement
               surpassed the target of 30 percent.
      Phone ownership: 51,000 female beneficiaries confirmed possession of phones, surpassing the
       target of 45,000 beneficiaries. Mobile phones played a crucial role in both cash transfers and
       economic inclusion, as beneficiaries received both the cash transfers and the business grants (under
       the third objective) directly into their mobile money wallets, which they accessed using their phones.

         The Bank clarified that the project provided SIM cards but did not support the acquisition of phones
         beyond providing cash transfers enabling beneficiaries to obtain them.

Outcomes

        Overall Beneficiary Reach:
             o There were 156,413 beneficiaries of safety net programs. This achievement surpassed the
                original target of 78,000 and the revised target of 152,000 beneficiaries.
              o There were 123,426 female beneficiaries of safety nets programs. This achievement
                surpassed the original target of 39,000 and the revised target of 108,000 female beneficiaries.
              o There were 104,240 beneficiaries of unconditional cash transfers. This achievement
                surpassed the original target of 40,000 and the revised target of 100,000 beneficiaries.

In addition, the project addressed some of the challenges pertaining to the fragmentation of the social
protection system through the following initiatives:

       o Development of a National Program: The project funded the creation of a national program for non-
         contributive social protection, which now serves as the foundation for the government's social
         assistance activities. This program is currently being supported and implemented through a Program-
         for-Results (PforR) initiative that followed the project.
       o Design of a Social Registry: The project facilitated the design of the Social Registry for Individuals
         and Households (Registre social des personnes et des ménages). Once fully implemented with
         funding from the PforR, this registry will act as a unified targeting mechanism, ensuring consistent
         beneficiary selection and minimizing overlap among various programs.
       o Grassroots Management Training: The project provided management training at the communal
         level, enhancing local communities' capabilities in development planning and social service provision.
         This empowerment helps local communities better manage their development processes and reduces
         the likelihood of fragmented external interventions that do not align with local needs.

Overall

The project not only met but, in many cases, significantly exceeded its targets, indicating strong progress
toward its objective of providing effective social safety nets to the poorest and most vulnerable communities.

OBJECTIVE 3 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
Provide poor communities and households with economic inclusion opportunities

Revised Rationale
The theory of change for this objective posited that by providing training, mentorship, and financial support,
households will be better equipped to start and manage their own businesses, facilitating economic inclusion.
This approach is designed to empower households to transition from relying on social safety nets to
becoming self-sufficient through productive employment opportunities. The additional provision of mobile
phones and digital financial literacy for those without access further strengthens this theory of change by
ensuring that even the poorest and most vulnerable households can participate in the program and benefit
from its opportunities.

The selection of households for economic inclusion measures was conducted using a systematic approach
that built upon the village selection process for cash transfers and was comprised of: (i) holding a public
lottery to randomly select villages for cash transfers within each of the 100 poorest cantons; (ii) designating
the first village selected in each canton as a beneficiary of both cash transfers and economic inclusion
measures, resulting in 100 villages receiving these dual benefits (one per poorest canton); (iii) including
a second village drawn from the largest cantons (i.e., those with the largest number of villages), bringing the
total to 125 beneficiary villages, with the number established in advance based on budget constraints; (iv)
identifying the five poorest neighborhoods in urban areas through the Poverty Targeting Index (PTI)
designated to receive economic inclusion measures; and (v) allowing all households in selected villages and
neighborhoods entitled to cash transfers to participate in economic inclusion measures.

Outputs and Intermediate Outcomes

      Economic Inclusion Measures:
           o There were 3,750 beneficiaries of economic inclusion measures in urban areas. Economic
            inclusion measures comprised business development training and the validation of a mini
            operating account for the selected income-generating activities, providing a productive grant of
            US$180 per beneficiary. This achievement met the target of 3,750 beneficiaries.
          o Ninety-three (93) percent of beneficiaries were women. This achievement surpassed the target
            of 75 percent.
          o 96.37 percent of beneficiaries reported being satisfied with economic inclusion measures. This
            achievement surpassed the target of 70 percent.
      Support Measures:
          o Beneficiaries of economic inclusion measures benefited from support measures to achieve
            sustainable livelihoods. These measures included the issuance of birth certificates, prenatal
            consultations and support for exclusive breastfeeding, education on sexual violence and abuse
            of children, and training on implementing income-generating activities and promoting family
            economies.

                                       target of 45,000 beneficiaries. As noted under Objective 2, beneficiaries received both the cash
                                       transfers and the business grants directly into their mobile money wallets, which they accessed using
                                       their phones. The project did not support the acquisition of phones beyond providing cash transfers
                                       enabling beneficiaries to obtain them.

                                      Beneficiary reach:
                                          o There were 15,001 beneficiaries of economic inclusion measures. This achievement met the
                                              target of 15,000 beneficiaries.
                                           o Ninety-two (92) percent of beneficiaries were women, surpassing the target of 75 percent.

                              The project demonstrated success in providing economic inclusion opportunities for vulnerable populations,
                              particularly women and youth. It exceeded targets for beneficiary reach, gender participation, and satisfaction.

 5. Efficiency
Economic efficiency. An economic analysis of the project's interventions was not conducted at appraisal or at
the project's conclusion. However, a unit cost analysis was undertaken to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the
project, revealing that the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure were accomplished economically. For
example, the unit cost for educational facilities, which accounted for 42 percent of all infrastructure sub-projects,
was 36.3 million FCFA, inclusive of materials and labor. This figure is notably lower than the anticipated 40
million FCFA and also falls beneath the threshold set by national procurement guidelines. Importantly, this cost
saving did not affect the quality of the infrastructure sub-projects. A technical audit rated the quality at 96.2
percent and functionality at 96 percent.

The project's cash transfer programs and initiatives to support income-generating activities were executed with
efficiency, maintaining administrative costs at a minimum. The operating costs aligned with the African average,
with the ratio of total expenses to total disbursements standing at 17.5 percent of the project costs, which is
comparable to the West African regional average of 17 percent. Furthermore, the ICR noted that although the
social safety net transfer amounts were modest relative to similar projects in the region, they were deemed
adequate for the beneficiaries' productive engagement and consumption stabilization.

Implementation efficiency. The project demonstrated several strengths in implementation efficiency, including:
(i) the simplicity of project design, focusing on three core areas, allowing other interventions to be addressed by
different projects; (ii) a robust targeting methodology, ensuring that resources were allocated efficiently; and (iii)
strong alignment with other Bank-financed initiatives, enhancing overall impact. The ICR stated that 88 percent
of micro-projects were completed within contractual deadlines. Implementation delays for the remaining micro-
projects were explained by: (i) insufficient organization of works by the companies, (ii) lack of financial capacity
of the companies to pre-finance the works, and (iii) low financial offers for contracts.

However, there were also moderate challenges, namely: (i) the project facing difficulties in transitioning to digital
payment methods, which hindered efficiency; (ii) the planned distribution of mobile phones being ultimately
dropped, affecting beneficiaries' access to essential services; (iii) concerns regarding "slow" compliance with
safeguards; and (iv) challenges encountered with the school feeding initiative. Delays and implementation
challenges can be explained by the following factors:

Initial Implementation Delays: Early stages of the project were hindered by the establishment of project
implementation structures, particularly concerning safeguards. These delays affected the preparation of
infrastructure sub-projects. However, the project team successfully addressed these challenges, allowing
subprojects to be delivered in accordance with the established timelines.

      TG-Safety Nets & Basic Services Project (P157038)



COVID-19 Adjustments: Like many projects, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated adjustments to
implementation modalities, which contributed to slowed progress.

Government Requests for Urban Cash Transfers: The government's request to provide cash transfers in urban
areas like Lomé led to a requirement for development of a new targeting methodology. This requirement
introduced additional delays.

Operational Delays: The project experienced typical operational delays, such as the slow development of Terms
of Reference and procurement issues. While these challenges are common across many projects, they did not
significantly impact this project compared to others.

On balance, these shortcomings in implementation efficiency are considered to be moderate. Overall project
efficiency is rated Substantial.

Ongoing support and resources will be required to sustain infrastructure investments, support for the cash
transfer programs and income-generating activities, and capacity development. Specifically:

    1. Sustainability of Infrastructure Investment. The sustainability of the project's infrastructure
       investments depends on the continued maintenance and operation of the facilities. The involvement
       of local communities and institutions in the management of these facilities is critical for ensuring their
       long-term functionality.
    2. Continuity of Social Safety Nets. The sustainability of the project's social safety nets depends on
       the continued availability of funding and the effective targeting of beneficiaries. The project's
       monitoring and evaluation systems will also need to be maintained to ensure the effective targeting
       and delivery of social safety nets.
    3. Economic Inclusion and Empowerment. The sustainability of the project's economic inclusion
       efforts depends on continued support for skills development, micro-enterprises, and access to
       financial services. The involvement of local institutions and the private sector will be critical for
       ensuring the long-term success of economic inclusion initiatives.
    4. Institutional Capacity. The sustainability of the project's outcomes depends on the continued
       capacity of local institutions to manage and sustain development initiatives. The involvement of
       community-based organizations and local government officials will be critical for ensuring the long-
       term sustainability of project outcomes.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  Project design was well aligned with Togo's development priorities and the World Bank's strategy in the
  country. It featured a relatively simple project structure focusing on three core activities. The Bank's
  extensive experience in social protection, particularly in Togo since 2004, informed the preparation of the
  project, leveraging past engagements with Togo's Ministry of Community Development. Lessons from
  earlier Bank-financed projects, namely the PDC and PDCplus, which aimed at promoting community
  development and social protection, were instrumental in refining the project's design, leading to the
  introduction of national-scale cash transfers. This project improved beneficiary targeting by combining
  geographic targeting with a PMT and community validation, ensuring a more inclusive approach.
  Additionally, insights from the Sahel region on shock responsiveness and climate adaptability were
  integrated into the project, enhancing household resilience to external shocks. This included "Cash++"
  interventions, which combine cash transfers with income-generating activities and training. The project
  also played a crucial role in Togo's COVID-19 response by expanding cash transfers to the poorest and
  providing technical assistance to bolster the social protection system. The project's design also included
  a strong focus on capacity building and community-based approaches, which contributed to its overall
  effectiveness.

  Project implementation was effectively managed by ANADEB (National Community Development
  Support Agency, Agence Nationale d’Appui au Développement à la Base), under the technical oversight
  of the Ministry of Grassroots Development, Youth, and Youth Employment (Ministère du Développement
  à la Base, de la Jeunesse et de l'Emploi des Jeunes). The project was firmly established within the



                                                                                                      Page 15 of 21

  framework of ANADEB, with its General Directorate taking charge of both execution and monitoring.
  Oversight was further ensured by a Board of Directors.

  Collaboration for project execution was formalized through agreements between ANADEB and the World
  Bank, complemented by a subsidiary agreement with the government outlining each party's role. The
  Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which included monitoring and evaluation specialists, was tasked with
  tracking the progress of the project's components. Oversight was provided by the General Director of
  ANADEB and a Strategic Coordinator, ensuring diligent monitoring and guidance.

  The Project Appraisal Document outlined a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy,
  identifying key risks as "Moderate" overall, with substantial concerns in political governance, institutional
  capacity, and fiduciary aspects. Mitigation measures included community-driven development
  approaches, capacity building initiatives, and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework to enhance
  local engagement.



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Satisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 The Bank's supervision efforts were instrumental in ensuring that the project not only met its goals but also
 adapted to the changing socio-economic landscape, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The project successfully mobilized additional funds to implement emergency cash transfers and economic
 inclusion activities, demonstrating a proactive approach to supervision that prioritized the needs of
 vulnerable populations during a crisis.

 The project implemented robust fiduciary management practices, including regular audits and financial
 reviews, which ensured compliance with Bank standards. The establishment of a GRM further enhanced
 accountability, allowing beneficiaries effectively to report issues related to project implementation.
 Additionally, the adequacy of supervision inputs and processes was evident through the comprehensive
 training provided to local agencies like ANADEB, which strengthened their capacity to manage social
 protection programs. Performance reporting was characterized by candor and quality, with regular
 assessments highlighting both achievements and challenges faced during implementation. This
 transparency allowed for timely adjustments to strategies and ensured that transition arrangements were in
 place for the continued operation of supported activities post-project closure.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The project's M&E design was robust, with a comprehensive results framework that included clear
 indicators and targets for measuring progress. The M&E system was designed to track both outputs and
 outcomes, ensuring that achievement of the project's objectives could be effectively assessed.

 ANADEB was charged with implementing the M&E framework. ANADEB relied on PDCplus staff,
 expanding the scope of its roles and responsibilities to better meet World Bank standards. Regional offices,
 staffed with experienced consultants, were to facilitate data collection and feedback to the PIU, enhancing
 monitoring and progress tracking. The involvement of local institutions and community-based organizations
 in the M&E process contributed to the accuracy and reliability of data.



b. M&E Implementation
  The implementation of the M&E system was effective, with regular data collection and reporting. The
  project management unit ensured that M&E activities were conducted as planned. The involvement of
  local stakeholders in the M&E process helped ensure that data was accurate and reflective of on-the-
  ground realities.



c. M&E Utilization
  The project demonstrated effectiveness in M&E by leveraging its decentralized structures to relay
  information from local implementation to the central level, allowing for timely adjustments to project
  execution. This adaptability was evident in several key areas, including:

  Temporary Biometric IDs: The project identified and implemented solutions to provide temporary
  biometric IDs to beneficiaries, enabling them to obtain SIM cards.

  Digital Literacy Support: When the need arose, the project offered ad-hoc digital literacy support to
  ensure beneficiaries could effectively utilize technology.

  SIM Card Replacement Assistance: The project also assisted households in replacing lost SIM cards,
  ensuring continued access to essential services.



  M&E Quality Rating

  Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11), and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) were triggered. The project
  developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
  Framework (RPF) to manage associated risks and impacts. The ESMF was updated to include economic
  inclusion measures and potential risks related to cash transfer activities. The project ensured compliance
  through a dedicated team of environmental and social safeguards specialists. A gender-based violence
  (GBV) action plan was developed, and GBV training was provided to project staff. Measures were also
  incorporated to handle complaints related to sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and sexual harassment
  (SH). The project adopted a four-step approach to ensure the environmental and social sustainability of
  business grants. This included developing a list of excluded activities, educating beneficiaries, assessing
  business plans for risks, and monitoring a subset of funded activities. With regard to the GRM, a three-tier
  complaint management mechanism was established at village, regional, and national levels. Sensitive
  complaints related to GBV, SEA, SH, and child exploitation were managed by the central level and
  specialized care structures. The GRM was operational (including on GBV aspects) and recorded cases and
  resolutions, addressing issues such as errors in inclusion/exclusion, payments, and fraudulent reporting.
  The results framework indicates that 100 percent of grievances were addressed within the timeframe
  established by the GRM manual and that 100 percent of cases submitted by women were addressed within
  the timeframe established by the GRM manual.

  All Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) assessed overall safeguards in the satisfactory
  range, with the exception of the January 4, 2019 ISR, which deemed them Moderately Unsatisfactory. This
  was explained by limited progress achieved on adopting recommendations from previous safeguards
  missions to reduce delays pertaining to the identification and validation of community microprojects and the
  selection of implementation sites, and project safeguards specialists estimating a six-month timeframe to
  screen all community microprojects for compliance with safeguards policies. The progression of overall
  safeguards ratings was as follows: initially, three ISRs conferred a Satisfactory rating, succeeded by a
  single ISR with a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating, thereafter four ISRs with a Moderately Satisfactory
  rating, and the final six ISRs bestowing a Satisfactory rating.




b. Fiduciary Compliance
  The project complied with the arrangements agreed upon at appraisal. Desk reviews were conducted
  quarterly for interim financial reports (IFR) and annually for audit reports, alongside continuous reviews of
  interim internal control systems reports as they became available. On-site visits included a biannual review
  of the financial management (FM) system's overall operation through implementation support missions and
  monitoring of actions based on findings from audit reports, auditors’ management letters, and internal
  audits, which, alongside transaction reviews, were conducted as necessary. Additionally, capacity building
  support was provided through FM training sessions throughout the implementation phase, highlighting a
  comprehensive approach to maintaining robust practices.

  ANADEB, serving as the dedicated PIU for the project, oversaw the accounting, expenditures, and
  resource management for the project, with FM responsibilities centralized at the PIU. An evaluation at the
  time of the project's additional financing found ANADEB's FM arrangements satisfactory, aligning with the
  World Bank's fiduciary standards for investment policy financing, with no significant changes from the
  original grant's FM practices, except for an added subcomponent to provide economic inclusion activities
  for additional beneficiaries. The FM risk for the AF was considered substantial due to potential risks
  associated with using the Novissi platform in a World Bank-funded project. The audited financial

   statements were timely and received an unqualified opinion, indicating no overdue audits or IFRs. There
   were no reported issues of corruption or misuse of funds associated with the project.

   Specific arrangements were made for the disbursement of cash through mobile operators. The specific
   arrangements for disbursing cash transfers and managing small business grants, as defined under Part
   B.3 of the Financing Agreement, involved ANADEB, the project's implementing agency, establishing
   agreements with Novissi and two mobile operators, Moov Africa Togo and Togocom. The project
   transferred funds to the mobile operators' accounts, with the amounts to be deposited confirmed by
   Novissi. Novissi then instructed the mobile operators to disburse payments to eligible beneficiaries, who
   received quarterly cash transfers of business grants. The mobile operators then reported the payment
   transactions to Novissi and ANADEB.

   All ISRs assessed compliance with procurement standards in the satisfactory range. The progression of
   procurement ratings was as follows: initially, six ISRs conferred a Satisfactory rating, succeeded by
   two ISRs with a Moderately Satisfactory rating. Thereafter, two ISRs assigned a Satisfactory rating,
   followed by two ISRs with Moderately Satisfactory ratings. The final two ISRs bestowed Satisfactory
   ratings.

   ISRs consistently rated financial management in the satisfactory range. The ratings evolved as follows: the
   first two ISRs issued a Satisfactory rating, which was followed by six ISRs that determined the rating to be
   Moderately Satisfactory, culminating in the final six ISRs restoring a Satisfactory rating.

Lessons can be drawn to highlight the importance of strategic design, community involvement,
digital innovation, flexibility, capacity building, and economic empowerment in the successful
implementation of social protection projects:

Lesson 1: Simplification and Targeting. Simplifying project design and focusing on core activities
can significantly enhance implementation efficiency. Employing a multi-step targeting strategy that
includes geographic targeting, PMT, and community validation can ensure that the most vulnerable
populations are accurately identified and included. This approach can streamline operations and
enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of social protection programs.

Lesson 2: Digital Innovations and Adaptability. Incorporating digital advancements in project
design can significantly improve the resilience and adaptability of social protection systems. Digital
payment methods and platforms, such as the Novissi platform used in Togo, can enhance the
efficiency and reach of cash transfer programs, especially in times of crisis. Prioritizing the
development and integration of digital tools can ensure timely and effective service delivery.

Lesson 3: Community Involvement and Local Governance. Engaging local communities and
strengthening local governance structures can be critical for the sustainability and success of social
protection programs. Community involvement can enhance the relevance and acceptance of
interventions and build local capacity and accountability. Future projects can benefit from prioritizing
community-driven approaches and investing in capacity building initiatives for local authorities.

Lesson 4: Flexibility and Responsiveness. Flexibility and responsiveness can be essential
attributes for the successful implementation of social protection projects. Designing projects with
built-in mechanisms for rapid adaptation to changing circumstances, such as economic shocks or
health crises, can ensure that projects can pivot effectively in response to unforeseen challenges.
This includes having contingency plans, flexible funding arrangements, and adaptive management
practices.

Lesson 5: Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. Investing in capacity building and
institutional strengthening can be fundamental for the long-term success and scalability of social
protection programs. Training and capacity building initiatives can equip implementing agencies with
the necessary skills and knowledge, enhancing the immediate effectiveness of the project and
building a robust foundation for future social protection efforts.

Lesson 6: Economic Inclusion and Empowerment. Combining cash assistance with economic
empowerment activities can significantly enhance the impact of social protection programs.
Providing beneficiaries with the tools and support needed for entrepreneurship and income
generation can help address employment barriers and build long-term resilience. Integrating
economic inclusion components can complement direct cash transfers and promote sustainable
livelihoods.
