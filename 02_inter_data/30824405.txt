2. Project Objectives and Components

a. Objectives

   The ICR covers a grant which is part of a larger parent project. The Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
   was done for administrative reasons as the grant had to be closed for the donor (The Australian Department
   of Foreign Affairs and Trade, DFAT) to be able to release new funding. The grant’s implementation period
   does thus not comply with the implementation period of the parent project. The ICR covers activities financed
   by the grant for the period of September 2009 to September 2017. A final ICR covering the parent project,
   including the grant, will be completed after closing of the parent project, which is expected on June 30th,
   2021.


                                                                                                  Page 1 of 17

     ID PAMSIMAS Support Trust Fund (P116236)



   The Project Development Objective (PDO) in the Original grant agreement was to "increase the number of
   low income rural and peri-urban populations accessing improved water and sanitation facilities and practicing
   improved hygiene behaviors as part of the Recipient's efforts to achieve Water Supply and Sanitation
   Millennium Development Goals (WSS-MDG), through programmatic mainstreaming and scaling-up of a
   nationwide community-driven approach" (Original grant agreement, Article I, paragraph 2.01., page 3).

   In March 2013, the Borrower submitted a request for restructuring of the parent project including a request
   for an adjustment of the PDO, which was approved by the Bank on October 30th, 2013, to; "increase the
   number of under-served and low income rural and peri-urban populations accessing improved and
   sustained water and sanitation services and practicing improved hygiene behaviors as part of the Recipient’s
   efforts to achieve WSS-MDG Targets, through programmatic mainstreaming and scaling-up of a nationwide
   community-driven approach." Thus, the revised PDO was almost identical to the original one, only adding a
   couple of words ("under-served", "sustained" and "targets"). Moreover, the PDO for the grant is the same as
   the one for the parent project. Therefore, this ICR review adopts the revised PDO. The review parses the
   PDO as follows:

   Objective 1: to increase the number of under-served and low income rural and peri-urban populations
   accessing improved and sustained water supply services;

   Objective 2: to increase the number of under-served and low income rural and peri-urban populations
   accessing improved and sustained sanitation services; and

   Objective 3: to increase the number of under-served and low income rural and peri-urban populations
   practicing improved hygiene behaviors.

d. Components

   Component 1: Community Empowerment and Local Institutional Development (Total grant allocation,
   including amendments: US$26.34 million; Actual: US$18.51 million)

   This component was to fund a program-specific training to 990 community facilitators in the field; to
   support interventions at community, district and provincial levels on Community Driven Development
   (CDD) planning; and management of Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) facilities. The component was

                                                                                                             Page 2 of 17

  also to provide technical training to support the training of trainers in the "Methodology for Participatory
  Assessment/Participatory Health and Sanitation Transformation (MPA/PHAST) approach and the
  Community Led Total Sanitation (STBM) program.

  Component 2: Village Incentive Grants: (Total grant allocation, including amendments US$54.79 million;
  Actual: US$43.96 million)

  This component was to provide village grants to finance community water improvement subprojects based
  on a menu of possible options. Water supply and communal sanitation infrastructure provision was based
  on Community Action Plans (CAP) that were prepared using the CDD approach. Village incentive grants
  were also allocated to villages that demonstrate good practice and exceeded the hygiene improvement,
  community mobilization, and WSS access targets identified in the CAP.

  Component 3: Implementation Support and Program Management (Total grant allocation, including
  amendments: US$9.27 million; Actual: US$3.82 million)

  This component provided technical assistance and capacity building for quality assurance of PAMSIMAS
  including an implementation adviser, a procurement and safeguards adviser; a monitoring and evaluation
  baseline survey and impact evaluation consultant, a community hygiene and sanitation behavior specialist;
  a management information systems/knowledge management specialist, an MPA/PHAST specialist, three
  Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program specialists and community facilitators.




e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates

  Project cost

  The total grant allocated from DFAT was US$90.4 million, of which US$46.4 million was provided in
  August 2009. As part of the preparation of the PAMSIMAS II, DFAT provided an additional grant in the
  amount of US$44.0 million. US$74.4 million is the sum of the amounts in the signed grants between the
  Bank and the Government as outlined in the first agreement in May 2009, and then in the five extensions
  of the agreement.

  Financing

  The grant was a TF financed by DFAT and administered by the World Bank. There was no borrower
  contribution to this grant.

  Dates

  The grant was approved on May 26, 2009 and effective on September 10, 2009. The original closing date
  was December 21, 2012 and the actual closing date was September 30, 2017, i.e. the grant experienced
  a 4 year and 9 months extension. The grant underwent five Level II restructurings; 1) on November 25,

                                                                                                      Page 3 of 17

   2010; 2) on June 13, 2012; 3) on October 31, 2012; 4) on April 23, 2014; and 5) on November 10, 2015.
   The reason for the restructurings were additional funds from DFAT (the grant was disbursed little by little),
   some minor re-allocations between categories and extension of the grant period.




3. Relevance of Objectives

  Rationale


  The Community Based Water and Sanitation Project (PAMSIMAS) was the third World Bank supported
  Project for Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities in Indonesia. PAMSIMAS is referred to
  as the "parent project" in the ICR and in this ICR review. The ICR of the DFAT PAMSIMAS Support Trust
  Fund grant is the subject of this review.

  Building on previous World Bank-supported Water and Sanitation projects in Indonesia, PAMSIMAS was a
  vehicle to help scale up the operationalization of the national sector Policy Framework for community-based
  water supply and sanitation and to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal for
  Water and Sanitation (MDG) 7c, to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and
  basic sanitation by 2015, as was outlined in the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN 2010-
  2014).

  The Project Development Objective (PDO) is well aligned with national priorities outlined in the National
  Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN 2014-2019), which targets the achievement of universal access to
  water and sanitation by the year 2019. The National Plan also promotes the community-led total sanitation
  approach.

  The PDO is furthermore well aligned with the World Bank’s Indonesia Country Partnership Framework (CPF)
  2016-202 in two key engagement areas: The delivery of national infrastructure (Engagement Area 1), and
  the delivery of local infrastructure and services (Engagement Area 4). The gender and governance approach
  under PAMSIMAS are well aligned with the Bank’s cross cutting engagements of shared prosperity, equality
  and inclusion.

  However, while there is clear alignment between the project’s development objectives and the country- and
  WB strategies, the relevance of the objectives (increased access to water and sanitation facilities) is not
  pitched at a sufficiently high level to suggest a potential solution to the development problem that the project
  is intended to address.　 In other words, the objective was not defined such that its achievements would be
  plausibly traceable to improvements envisioned to arise from increased access to water supply and
  sanitation services, such as improvements in health outcomes, production and income or other factors
  affecting community livelihoods (which are the expected high level outcomes as stated in the ICR’s Theory of
  Change on page 9). These may be longer term targets but tracking them and identifying them is an important
  aspect of a successful development operation.

    Objective 1
    Objective

     Objective 1: to increase the number of under-served and low income rural and peri-urban populations
     accessing improved and sustained water supply services

    Rationale

    Theory of Change for Objective 1:

    The inputs/activities were training of community facilitators, sanitation trainers and stakeholder committees;
    technical assistance and capacity building in M&E, management information systems and Community Driven
    Development; technical support for community action plans; financial support in design, construction and
    supervision of water supply infrastructures; and provision of grants for villages. Outputs were expected to be
    Community action plans; improved water supply systems; and improved water supply in schools. These
    outputs were expected to lead to outcomes such as an increased number of under-served and low income
    rural and peri-urban populations accessing improved and sustained water supply services. This was in turn
    expected to lead to higher level outcomes such as improved health condition of the rural and low-income
    population and to increased human development and earning capacity.

    Outputs:

    All listed outputs are the same for all three objectives, as they may equally relate to water supply services,
    sanitation services, and hygiene behaviors:


        • 2,251 villages developed Community Action Plans, exceeded both the original target of 460 and met the
        revised target of 2,215.
        • 387,660 people participated in village plena meetings for the preparation of Community Action Plans
        (this indicator had no original nor revised target).
        • 95 percent of the districts had a project monitoring structure and tools that provided regular information
        on project implementation quality, exceeding both the original and revised targets, which both were 90
        percent. According to the ICR (page 38), the central government built a strong MIS system that facilitated
        the flow of information.
        • 20 percent of the total project cost was actual community contribution (in cash and kind), meeting both
        the original and revised targets of 20 percent.


                                                                                                         Page 5 of 17

      ID PAMSIMAS Support Trust Fund (P116236)



  • 1,669 villages and districts exceeded the project performance criteria and received supplementary
  grants, exceeding both the original target of 500 and the revised target of 1.649 villages.
  • 92 percent of all registered grievances related to project activities were addressed, almost reaching the
  original and revised targets of 95 percent.
  • 87 percent of target schools had improved water supply and sanitation facilities and hygiene programs
  exceeded the original target of 75 percent but did not achieve the revised target of 95 percent.


The following outputs were reported in the ICR but without information on what the targets were:


  • 1,187 community facilitators trained on preparation of community action plans to improve water and
  sanitation in the community.
  • 365 district stakeholder committees trained on selection and monitoring of eligible villages.




Outcomes:

Outcome indicator #1: Number of additional people with sustainable access to improved water facilities,
differentiated by socioeconomic status.


  • 1,870,067 additional people had sustainable access to improved water facilities, exceeding both the
  original target of 550,000 people and the revised target of 1,772,000 people.
  • Of the total number of beneficiaries, 1,002,712 beneficiaries were women, exceeding both the original
  target of 275,000 women and the revised target of 886,000 women.
  • About 44 percent of the beneficiaries (corresponding to 882,830 beneficiaries) were poor
  • 83 percent of the villages with improved water supply systems functioned to the satisfaction of the
  majority of the target community, not achieving the original or revised targets of 90 percent.


There are no outcome indicators to measure outcomes beyond the number of beneficiaries and the
satisfaction of the target community. The ICR (figure on p. 9 and para. 16 on p. 11) states that improved
health conditions and earning capability were intended to be high level outcomes of this project while also
making it clear that these outcomes were expected to be long term and outside the scope of the project. To
be able to measure a reduction of disease within the project’s time frame would perhaps be too much to ask,
but the impact on intermediate outcomes, such as measures of direct improvements in water quality (e.g.
foreign matter, toxins, harmful bacteria, etc.) would have been possible and beneficial. Furthermore, the
village satisfaction with improved water supply was below both the original and revised target.

        • 365 district stakeholder committees trained on selection and monitoring of eligible villages.




    Outcomes:

    Outcome indicator #2: Number of additional people with sustainable access to sanitation facilities,
    differentiated by socioeconomic status.


        • 1,825,904 additional people with sustainable access to improved sanitation facilities, exceeding both the
        original target of 160,000 people and the revised target of 775,000 people.
        • Of the total beneficiaries, 861,150 beneficiaries were women, exceeding both the original target of
        80,000 women and the revised target of 378,000 women.
        • About 44 percent of the beneficiaries (corresponding to 803,400 beneficiaries) were poor.




    According to the ICR, this overachievement was made possible because the target had originally been
    estimated at sub-village level. During implementation it became clear that it would be possible to expand
    project activities to village level and this resulted in the over-achievement.


        •56 percent of the target communities were free of open defecation, not achieving the original target of 60
        percent but exceeding the revised target of 50 percent.


    There are no outcome indicators to measure outcomes beyond the number of beneficiaries and reduction in
    open defecation.

Rationale

Theory of Change for Objective 3:

The inputs/activities were training of community facilitators, sanitation trainers and stakeholder committees;
technical assistance in M&E and Community Driven Development; and technical support for community
action plans. Outputs were expected to be Community action plans; improved sanitation systems; improved
sanitation in schools; communities free of open defecation; and hygiene programs in schools. These outputs
were expected to lead to outcomes such as an increased number of under-served and low income rural and

higher level outcomes such as improved health condition of the rural and low-income population and to
increased human development and earning capacity.

  • 20 percent of the total project cost was actual community contribution (in cash and kind), meeting both
  the original and revised targets of 20 percent.
  • 1,669 villages and districts exceeded the project performance criteria and received supplementary
  grants, exceeding both the original target of 500 and the revised target of 1.649 villages.
  • 92 percent of all registered grievances related to project activities were addressed, almost reaching the
  original and revised targets of 95 percent.
  • 87 percent of target schools had improved water supply and sanitation facilities and hygiene programs,
  exceeding the original target of 75 percent but not achieving the revised target of 95 percent.

              The following outputs were reported in the ICR but without information on what the targets were:


                   • 1,187 community facilitators trained on preparation of community action plans to improve water and
                   sanitation in the community.
                   • 365 district stakeholder committees trained on selection and monitoring of eligible villages.




              Outcomes:


                   •56 percent of the target communities were free of open defecation, not achieving the original target of 60
                   percent but exceeding the revised target of 50 percent.


              Apart from the indicator on reduction in open defecation, there were no outcome indicators in the results
              framework covering the improvement of other kinds of hygiene behaviors. However, the ICR text and tables
              contain references to handwashing with soap as an outcome (see e.g. para 12 p. 10 and para 51 p.
              20). The ICR reports (para 49 p. 20) that “According to the MIS, of the targeted communities by the Project,
              70% (target 60%) had adopted hand washing programs. However, the Rapid Beneficiary Survey conducted
              in December 2017 found a higher result, that 84% of households interviewed practice regular hand-washing.
              Of the targeted communities financed by the Grant, about 57% have reached ODF status exceeding the
              target of 50%, and more than 87.5% (75% target) of targeted schools have improved sanitation facilities and
              hygiene programs. Although the results framework did not have a relevant indicator to measure the
              improvements of other hygiene behaviors than reduction in open defecation, the ICR demonstrates
              achievement beyond targets for the practice of regular handwashing with soap. The achievement of
              objective 3 is therefore rated Substantial.

5. Efficiency


No economic analysis was undertaken of the grant funds. An economic analysis was done for the overall
project in 2015, which the ICR is referring to and using to assess the efficiency of the grant, as "the type of
interventions is exactly the same" (ICR para 55 page 21).

The ICR, based on an ex post economic analysis undertaken in 2015, concluded that the Economic Rate of
Return EIRR) for PAMSIMAS was estimated at 44 percent. The EIRR for the adjusted benefit and cost streams
was estimated at 36.1 percent, taking into consideration partly functioning and non-functioning sub-projects
and comparable to EIRRs observed for piped water supply systems financed by other Community Driven
Development programs in Indonesia. As the cost per capita of water supply interventions decreased and the
benefits remained the same, the ICR states that the EIRR was expected to be the same if not better at the time
of the ICR. The average unit cost for a piped water connection under this project was less than 35 percent of
the average cost of a connection provided by a water utility or by the central government.

For administrative efficiency, the co-financing arrangements allowed for efficiency gains, according to the ICR
(para 58, page 22) because the existing institutional arrangements for the overall project were used also for the
grant. The total cost of the Implementation Support and Project Management component dropped from 19
percent of the total project cost to 12 percent.

The lack of an economic analysis of the grant funds is an important shortcoming. Furthermore, there were
some administrative inefficiencies (delays and unused funds). IEG finds it plausible, however, that the ICR’s
assertion that the 2015 economic analysis also applies to this grant project. This is the main reason for the
Substantial rating of Efficiency.

6. Outcome


Although the project’s objectives are well aligned with both country and Bank strategies, the PDO is pitched at a
level that does not adequately represent a development outcome in terms of impact on beneficiary well-being,
and Relevance of Objectives is therefore rated Modest. Overall efficacy was rated substantial, with that of the
first objective rated modest, but efficacy of the second and third objectives rated substantial. Efficiency is rated
Substantial despite some inefficiencies, as IEG is prepared to accept the assertion that the 2015 economic
analysis of the parent project also applies to this grant. Thus, the overall Efficacy rating is Satisfactory.


a.    Outcome Rating
      Satisfactory


7. Risk to Development Outcome


Technical risk: According to the ICR (page 33), the technical risk is moderate, as the investments for the
physical infrastructure for both water supply and sanitation were relatively inexpensive and not technically
complex. Despite mitigation measures like the forming of dedicated management units and community groups,
24 percent of the PAMSIMAS-financed water supply systems were functioning at less than 80 percent of their
design capacity, partly because of design errors or lack of technical capacity to repair the systems.

Financial risk: Despite the expectation that the Drinking Water Supply System (BP-SPAM) projects are to
implement full cost-recovery tariffs, only 75 percent of the projects collected tariffs. But only 42 percent of those
collected tariffs at a level sufficient to cover operations and maintenance costs. (ICR, pp.33) The financial risk is
therefore moderate to substantial.

Political risk: The political risk is considered to be low as the central government and most local governments
have shown a strong and long-term commitment to PAMSIMAS.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry

     The design of the grant was based on the design of the parent project which took lessons from previous
     projects into account in its design, notably the need to establish better inter-sectoral collaboration and the
     need for incentives for local government ownership. The project and grant design included provision of
     simple and affordable options to keep cost-recovery tariffs low. Implementation of the social and



                                                                                                        Page 12 of 17

  environmental management framework was built into the project oversight structures, guidelines and
  tools.

  Technical, financial and economic aspects followed the parent project and poverty and gender aspects
  were taken into account in the design. The results framework had some weaknesses in that very few
  indicators at outcome level were identified, making it challenging to document and report on
  achievements at outcome level. Quality at entry is rated Satisfactory.


  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Satisfactory

b. Quality of supervision

  The Bank team conducted 11 supervision mission during the eight-year grant implementation period and
  addressed key issues that adversely affected the project at an early stage. These were delays in budget
  execution and revision, consultant mobilization and compliance with safeguards policies. The Bank team
  also conducted technical missions in between the supervision missions, visited about 150 villages per
  year, supported pilot programs and mobilized technical expertise. All team members were located at the
  country office which allowed for close and continuous supervision, and the team collaborated closely with
  the government. One shortcoming was that the results framework was not adequately revised in any of
  the many restructurings to incorporate more and more relevant outcome indicators so as to allow for the
  documentation and reporting on project achievements at the outcome level.


  Quality of Supervision Rating
  Satisfactory

  Overall Bank Performance Rating
  Satisfactory




9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design

  The M&E design of the grant was fully based on the one for the parent project. The results framework
  is sound, but with some shortcomings, especially in the relatively low level of the PDO as it does not
  offer a solution to a development problem, and the lack of appropriate indicators at outcome level
  beyond the number of beneficiaries is also a weakness in the M&E design. The institutional
  arrangements were sound and followed those of the parent project. The Central Management Advisory
  Consultants were to help the implementing agency to establish and maintain a comprehensive

                                                                                                 Page 13 of 17

  computerized management information system (MIS) to monitor achievement of each identified
  indicator.



b. M&E Implementation

  According to the ICR (para 84 page 28), the monitoring of the grant was well implemented through the MIS,
  spot-checking by consultants and by the complaints handling system. Grant funds were used to upgrade the
  parent project’s M&E from a manual paper-based system to a web-based platform that was later integrated
  into a mobile system. The funds from the grant also allowed for gradual and sustained evolution of the MIS.
  MIS data collection and independent verification was systematic and institutionalized. User satisfaction was
  measured through surveys. One shortcoming was the failure to address the lack of adequate outcome
  indicators in the results framework.



c. M&E Utilization

  M&E data was used to identify and remedy quality problems and incorporate better controls as the project
  progressed, to fine-tune the targeting of resources and to ensure transparency and openness. According to
  the ICR (para 88 page 29), the MIS was an essential tool used beyond the project implementation by the GoI
  to monitor progress and as a tool for decision making.



  M&E Quality Rating
  Substantial

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards

  The Grant was classified Category B as it was regarded unlikely to lead to significant social and
  environmental impacts. The safeguards assessment was done for the parent project PAMSIMAS and it
  applied to the grant as well. The safeguards triggered were Environmental Assessment (PO/BP 4.01) and
  Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.20). Given the small size of the subprojects (not exceeding US$30,000
  equivalent), it was expected that any adverse social or environmental impact would be small and negligible.
  The safeguard frameworks documents were disclosed in both Bahasa Indonesia and English on March 27,
  2013. The Indigenous Peoples’ Plan was disclosed in country on December 19, 2012 and in the Infoshop on
  December 28, 2012.

  The parent project put in place a comprehensive safeguards framework, according to the ICR (para 90 page
  29), which was monitored by the Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) and the Bank. The grant

                                                                                                 Page 14 of 17

  component 3 financed a procurement and safeguards adviser who provided technical assistance and
  capacity building for quality assurance of PAMSIMAS. The ICR concludes (para 94 page 30) that the grant
  had been generally complying with the safeguards requirements except for the minor deficiencies in the
  recording of Voluntary Land Donations (VLD).




b. Fiduciary Compliance

  Financial Management:

  The grant experienced delays in issuance of budget documents and challenges with the introduction of a
  new public financial management system, and these problems were exacerbated by difficulties in finding
  qualified facilitators. The project received unqualified opinions from an external auditor for each year from
  2009 until 2016. The Implementing agency ensured that provincial and district governments followed up on
  audit findings.

  Procurement:

  The grant generally complied with the Bank’s procurement guidelines. Procurement was rated moderately
  satisfactory throughout project implementation mainly due to delays in the recruitment of consultants. These
  delays affected the quality of the grant implementation, according to the ICR (para 96 page 31), and included
  delayed mobilization of consultants and facilitators, salary payments, distribution of socialization and training
  materials, and delays in training of facilitators and consultants.

12. Lessons


The lessons are taken from the ICR (pages 34-35) with some adjustment to language:


  • Partnership and collaboration between stakeholders are important for successful implementation of
  a large-scale program. The instruments developed under the program to boost partnership and
  collaboration were the following: institutional (collaborative task force), planning (single plans for all), single
  information systems (web-based MIS), and support systems (facilitators).
  • Use of ICT helps maintain a high level of transparency in all aspects of the project cycle. All
  information about the project was made available on the project's website, including payment advice from the　
  State Treasury Office and audit findings. The policy of transparency and openness aimed at creating public
  trust and confidence in the project. 　
  • Investments in sanitation infrastructure　are important to　secure　benefits of hygiene and
  sanitation behavior programs in CDD projects. People in the villages were not always able or willing to
  invest in private sanitation facilities. The project therefore provided communal sanitation facilities in schools
  and public locations so everybody would have access to sanitary facilities. 　




13. Assessment Recommended?

No

14. Comments on Quality of ICR


The ICR provides a lot of information and it generally follows the guidelines. The project’s theory of change
is clearly presented (p.9). Producing an ICR of a small grant while the parent project is still ongoing is not an
easy task, especially since the grant’s administration, implementation and M&E system are part of the
overall project. The presentation of the grant and the project is relatively unclear and messy in the ICR. It
does, however, clearly present the evidence of the achievements of the project according to the identified
indicators. The ICR lacks information on the five restructurings of the grant and it would have been useful for
the ICR to delve into the limitations of the project's limited outcome indicators which do not sufficiently cover
the complexity of the activities and the project intentions.
