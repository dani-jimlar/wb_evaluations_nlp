EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The Program Document (PD) for the Burkina Faso First Fiscal Management, Sustainable Growth and Health
Service Delivery Development Policy Operation (DPF) stated the program development objectives (PDOs) as
follows (PD1, p.3):

To support the Government’s efforts to:

      PDO1: strengthen fiscal management;
      PDO2: improve natural resources management and raise mining and livestock productivity;
      PDO3: improve health service delivery.

The PDO of the third DPF was stated as (PD3, p.3):

To support the Government’s efforts to:

      PDO1: strengthen fiscal management;
      PDO2: improve natural resources management and livestock productivity; and
      PDO3: enhance public service delivery and social spending efficiency.

A series of changes were made to the PDOs during the lifespan of the series:

    1. In DPF1 and DPF2 of the series, the second objective (PDO2) included the mining sector and was set as
       “improve natural resource management and raise mining and livestock productivity”. However, by the
       time of appraisal of the third operation (DPF3), mining was dropped. While artisanal mining provided
       employment to around 500,000 people at the time of DPF1, the World Bank support to the sector had
       materialized through a complimentary investment lending operation by the time that DPF3 was approved.
    2. PDO3 which sought to “improve health service delivery” in DPF1 (PD1, p.3); was expanded to “improve
       health service delivery and social spending efficiency” in DPF2 (PD2, p.3). However, by the time of
       appraisal of DPF3, health was dropped altogether and the PDO3 was expanded to “enhance public
       service delivery and social spending efficiency”.

By the time DPF3 was approved, Burkina Faso had been elected to the Prevention and Resilience Allocation
(PRA) envelope as a Fragile, Conflict and Violence affected country (FCV), and became the first country to gain
eligibility to the IDA19-PRA. PDO adjustments sought to better align the DPF series with the IDA19-FCV
envelope, which was meant to assist governments in mitigating the risk of conflict escalation through, inter alia,
inclusive governance and improved public service delivery. To become eligible for this funding, countries had to
recalibrate their World Bank portfolio and focus on conflict risk mitigation.

For the purposes of this ICRR, the PDOs of the series (against which outcomes will be assessed) are taken as
follows:

        PDO1: Strengthen fiscal management;
        PDO2: Improve natural resources management;
        PDO3: Improve livestock productivity;
        PDO4: Enhance public service delivery;

                                                                                                     Page 3 of 37

      PDO5: Enhance social spending efficiency.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The series had three pillars as follows:

    1. strengthening fiscal management;
    2. improving natural resources management and livestock productivity;
    3. enhancing public service delivery and social spending efficiency.

Changes introduced in the original program pillars reflected those made to the PDOs and discussed in section
2a. These included changes in the indicative triggers as they became prior actions for subsequent operations,
and in the context of a deteriorating security context in implementing the series.


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

    1. The first operation (DPF1) consisted of an IDA grant of EUR 87.6 million (US$100 million equivalent).
       DPF1 was approved on 24 April 2019, and closed as envisaged on 30 June 2020.
    2. The second operation (DPF2) consisted of an IDA credit for EUR 67.60 million (US$73.975 million
       equivalent), and an IDA grant SDR 54.30 (US$73.975 million equivalent). DPF2 was approved on 5
       June 2020 and closed as envisaged on 30 June 2021.
    3. The third operation (DPF3) consisted of an IDA grant of SDR 71 million (US$100 million equivalent) and
       an IDA credit of EUR 86.5 million (US$100 million equivalent). The amount disbursed for DPF3 was
       US$179.4 million. The difference between the amounts approved and disbursed was due to the
       appreciation of USD to both SDR and Euro at the time. DPF3 was approved on 6 December 2021 and
       closed as expected on 31 December 2022.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 The objectives of the series were relevant to the country situation, the government’s reform program(s), and
 the Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) 2017 and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY18-23
 priorities for Burkina Faso.

 Relevance to country context

 Burkina Faso is a landlocked country confronted with security, humanitarian, and social challenges. With a
 Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$ 670 in 2018, Burkina Faso is among the 20 poorest countries
 in the world. Mining and agriculture contributed 40 percent of the country’s GDP and 85 percent of its
 employment in 2019. Extreme poverty, measured by the US$1.9 a day (2011 PPP) poverty line was
 estimated at 38 percent in 2019. Poverty is estimated to have increased further due to the impacts of COVID-
 19, (ICR, p.6).

The implementation period of the series had some important changes shortly after the appraisal of DPF1. At
the onset of the series, Burkina Faso was not classified as an FCV country, although it had suffered a string
of terrorist attacks, especially in the North and East, in the aftermath of its 2014-15 political transition that
included a revolution, failed coup, and successfully executed elections. Following approval of DPF1, the
security situation deteriorated further, due to episodes of terrorism and violent conflict, which led to Burkina
Faso being classified as an FCV country in FY20.

Security challenges were compounded by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As the number of
fatalities increased in the first six months of 2021, a state of emergency was imposed on six of the country’s
13 provinces. The number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) increased from an estimated 39,000 in 2018
to over 1.4 million by 2021, and more than 2 million by 2023. (ICR, p.12). Massive service disruption occurred
as schools and public offices had to close. The number of school closures reached 2,410 at end-February
2020, while 120 health centers were closed and 153 others were impaired, leaving 881,000 people with
limited or no access to health. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to more school and health center
closures, making Burkina Faso one of the three most affected states by COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. In
response, the World Bank approve a standalone Covid-19 Crisis-Response DPF (CR-DPF), necessary to
confront the impacts of the pandemic. This DPF was connected to the three-series reform program and
some actions became complementary, such as setting up a social registry (in DPF3) as a follow-up from the
standalone operation.

Relevance to country development strategy

The DPF series objectives reflected government priorities specified in the three strategic pillars and were
pertinent to the country context.

The government’s 2016-2020 National Economic and Social Development Plan) (PNDES I) consisted of
three pillars: (i) Economic governance; (ii) Human capital development; and (iii) Structural economic
transformation and private sector development. PNDES I emphasized the need to improve the supply of
essential service delivery inputs and to put in place sustainable financing mechanisms for healthcare in a
resource-constrained context. The PNDES also highlights climate change among the key drivers of
vulnerability and included the Government’s commitment on mitigation and adaptation action to transition to a
green economy. In 2017, PNDES I was supplemented by the Emergency Program for the Sahel/Burkina
Faso (PUS-BF) to address governance and essential services deficits and strengthen economic resilience.
PNDES I is aligned with key objectives of the series, such as DPF1 (strengthening fiscal management),
PDO4 (enhancing public service delivery) and PDO5 (enhancing social spending efficiency).

The Emergency Response Plan (ERP) (2020) which sought to offset the negative effects of the pandemic
was also aligned with multiple objectives of the DPF series. There was alignment with public service/health
delivery improvements, social spending efficiency and the improvement of livestock productivity and natural
resources management. The ERP supported vulnerable households and individuals through cash
transfers, temporary tax incentives, and fiscal support to vulnerable sectors (e.g., fiscal support to the hotel,
commerce, transportation industries). PNDES II, approved in 2021, consists of four strategic pillars: (i)
strengthening resilience, security, social cohesion, and peace; (ii) deepening institutional reforms and the
modernization of public administration; (iii) consolidating sustainable human development and solidarity; and
(iv) boosting sectors that are promising for the economy and jobs. As in the new PNDES II, DPF3 placed
particular focus on conflict-affected areas (tackling insecurity) and climate vulnerabilities (building resilience).

     BF DPO1 (P166298)



Relevance to CPF and WBG priorities

The CPF FY18-FY23 is aligned with PNDES I and consistent with WBGs comparative advantage. CPF
FY18-23 priorities were (i) improving agriculture productivity; (ii) addressing management of extractives and
sustainability of natural resources; (iii) expanding access to health services; (iv) expanding social protection
to the most vulnerable; and (v) strengthening domestic resource mobilization and public expenditure
management. The CPF also identified three binding constraints to the country’s development and capacity to
achieve growth: (i) scarce public resources; (ii) low agricultural and mining productivity; (iii) inefficient health
and social service delivery, which were aligned with PDO1(strengthening fiscal management), PDO3
(improving livestock productivity), PDO4 (enhancing public service delivery) and PDO5 (enhancing social
spending efficiency).

The SCD (2017) highlighted largely underdeveloped social protection mechanisms, the lack of resources to
prop up growth and a highly fragmented institutional framework. The three so-called first-tier priorities
identified by the SCD (2017) were: (i) the improvement of natural resources management, (ii) the
development of skills and (iii) greater gender equality. Improving the management of the country’s two main
assets, land, and mineral resources, as well as two scarce resources, water, and energy sources, was
considered vital to achieving sustained growth. The SCD (2017) further identified fiscal management,
alongside governance, as a cross-cutting requirement for effective policymaking.

Consistent with the WBG commitment from December 2020 to increase the Climate Co-Benefits target from
28 to 35 percent of its financing, DPF3 sought to tackle specific climate vulnerabilities through three prior
actions in the following areas: (i) protecting forested areas from land use change, in particular from
encroachment through mining; (ii) vaccinating livestock to support herder climate-resilience; and (iii)
improving the climate-shock responsiveness of the social safety net system.


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The three operations had a total of 26 prior actions (PAs) (9 PAs in DPf1, 11 PAs in the DPF2 and 6 PAs in
DPF3).

Strengthening fiscal management was important in the context of rising economic insecurity and fiscal
pressures. The fiscal deficit had widened to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2017. A food crisis in 2018, due in part to
poor rainfall and a drop in cereal production led to higher levels of food insecurity. About half of the country’s
45 provinces and an estimated 950,000 persons were affected by food insecurity, which, combined with the
security situation, led to high public investment spending and a hike in the public wage bill, which made up
8.9 percent of GDP in 2018. With recurrent and prolonged strikes in the civil service, social unrest put upward
pressure on wages and recurrent transfers to the energy sector, thereby reducing the quality of public
spending. In this context, fiscal space for the Government’s ambitions to address large deficits in
infrastructure and social services had further narrowed. Burkina Faso entered an IMF Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) program in March 2018, supported by the World Bank DPF series.

PA1, PA2 and PA3: The tax system was undermined by shortcomings in terms of affordability, fairness, and
transparency, making tax filing costly and inefficient. These shortcomings were also reflected in inefficient tax
filing and payment procedures and numerous small taxes, as well as a narrow tax base with a concentration
of tax revenue collection in a few locations (mostly Ouagadougou) and sectors. The tax-to-GDP ratio was
hovering between 15 and 16 percent between 2020 and 2023, below the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU) target of 20 percent. Despite accounting for over a quarter of GDP and employing
80 percent of the active population, the informal economy is seriously undertaxed and contributes only
marginally to tax revenues. Prior actions 1,2 and 3 sought to contribute to streamlining the tax collection
process through electronic means and improving the functioning of the tax system. By simplifying the
registration process for taxpayers and enabling online tax filing, PA1 made a meaningful contribution to
broadening the tax base, thus facilitating taxation of the informal economy which accounts for over a quarter
of the country’s GDP and employs 80 percent of the working population (PD3, p. 20). PA2 followed on PA1
by taking the next step of making e-payment of taxes obligatory for large firms, thus allowing for efficiency
gains in tax filing and administrative procedures, which had long contributed to low net tax revenues and a
tax-to-GDP ratio of about 16 percent. PA3 built on the achievements of the prior operations regarding tax
simplification and the broadening of the tax base by reducing administrative costs on tax filing through the
mandatory filing of taxes for large firms and simplifying the filing process for small firms, which had long faced
large hurdles in tax compliance due to a heavy administrative workload associated with tax filing. However,
“small formal enterprises” were exempted from the reform (PD 3, p.20, footnote 19). Relevance of PA1:
Satisfactory (S). PA2: Satisfactory (S). PA3: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA4 and PA5: sought to increase the tax intake from registered property. Burkina Faso relied on a self-
declarative system for land property and associated taxes were based on the voluntary (and frequently
biased) declarations of property owners on the value of their land and dwellings. As of September 2018, the
registry included about 122,000 land plot holders, i.e. about a quarter of the estimated 500,000 holders. PA4
was highly relevant in supporting the set-up and operationalization of an urban registry that would allow for
better monitoring of lot use and subsequent administrative enforcement of taxation measures based on
sound criteria. PA5 built on PA4 by setting out the criteria and institutional logic of a decree that assesses
land and housing property value. While the urban registry was for land plots in Ouagadougou and Bobo
Dioulasso, the system for valuing land and housing property was only applicable in Ouagadougou, and the
prior action was reworded in DPF2 to reflect that fact. Relevance of PA4: Satisfactory (S); PA5:
Satisfactory (S).

PA6 and PA7: contributed directly to improving spending efficiency. Efficient use of public investment
expenditure had become a key factor in rebalancing fiscal expenditure prior to the start of the series. After
spending 10.1 percent of GDP in public investment, the government was obliged to cut down expenditure to
5.7 percent of GDP in 2019, following both the ECF Agreement with the IMF and the World Bank’s 2017

Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA). The latter highlighted the need for an independent
technical review of the quality of projects and called for the adoption of a standard methodology in project
appraisal, management, and budgeting, including public private partnerships (PD2, p. 23). PA6 supported the
adoption of a revamped regulatory framework towards more efficient project selection. However, the guide for
project assessment and appraisal only referred to major investment projects (ICR, p. 24), reducing its overall
effectiveness. PA7 made a modest contribution to the same objective by establishing a national committee to
validate appraisal documents. While the committee is operational, the committee’s composition and set of
working criteria establishing a transparent selection mechanism are unclear. Relevance of PA6: Moderately
Satisfactory (MS); PA7: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).

PA8, PA9 and PA10: were part of a results chain aimed at containing the growth of the public sector wage
bill and inefficient utilization of civil service resources. Since 2014, compensation increases had contributed
about half of wage bill increases, while sector-specific agreements had resulted in large increases in average
salaries in 2014 and 2016, and new commitments in 2017 and early 2018. Paygrade distortions were
common through special status linked to specific salaries or allowances as well as the inability to redeploy
civil servants from one ministry to another (PD 3, p.21). Thus, in a context of heightened demographic
pressures and a deteriorating security situation, the number of public employees rose from 93,000 in 2010 (1
staff per 168 inhabitants) to 210,000 in 2020. The public sector wage bill had reached 63.7 percent of tax
revenue in 2020, up from 33.5 percent in 2012, well above the WAEMU convergence criterion of 35 percent
(PD2, p.24; PD3, p. 22). PA8 supported an inclusive consultation that included the state and trade unions in
setting a new framework of compensation and rationalization of salary scales, as well as the rationalization of
their benefit system. The non-binding character of the consultation left the modalities of implementation
unclear. PA9 contributed through the rationalization of staff bonuses in the Ministry of Economy, Finance and
Development and a staff census in the Ministry of Education, which accounted for almost half of all civil
servants (PD3, footnote 25) and which could allow for future staff redeployment based on merit and need.
PA10 supported establishing transparent recruitment procedures as well as clear redeployment procedures

The mining sector had recorded a boom over the last two decades, becoming one of the largest contributors
to economic growth and public revenue (15 percent of state budget equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2021)
and accounting for approximately 50 percent of total exports. However, spillovers from the modern mining
sector were limited. The artisanal mining sector represented a growing source of income in Burkina Faso but
was faced with limited productivity. At the time of appraisal of DPF1, employment in artisanal mining was
estimated at approximately 500,000 jobs, consisting mainly of informal gold mining. Key constraints in the
sector including fraudulent exports to other countries undermined tax revenue. Formalizing artisanal mining
exports was expected to increase tax revenue and enhance multiplier effects on employment and incomes.

State forests, which represent about 40 percent of the forested area, are at risk of deforestation and forest
degradation from agriculture and mining. The State forests are protected by decree, but the lack of clear
delimitation and registration in the mining and land cadasters have provided an opportunity for other actors to
change the land use. As percentage of land area, forests continuously declined from 25 percent in 1990 to
19.3 percent in 2016, divided between State-owned classified forest and protected forests managed locally
by villages and communes.

PA11 and PA12: sought to raise productivity in the artisanal mining sector through tax cuts in mining exports
and contribute to sustainable management of natural resources by banning mining from protected areas.
Artisanal gold production was estimated at 9.5 tons in 2016, representing 3.5 percent of GDP, yet only 200
kgs of artisanal gold mining were formally and legally exported. The lack of formalization and low productivity
had long plagued the sector, and in 2015 the government set up the National Agency for Management of
Mining and Semi-Mechanized Operations (Agence Nationale d’ Encadrement et d’Encadrement et des
Exploitations Minieres et Semi— mécanisée, ANEEMAS) to monitor and manage artisanal and semi-
mechanized gold mining activities. On taxation, the export tax rate was 600 West African francs (CFA) per
gram of gold exports from artisanal mining in 2018, a prohibitively high tax rate. The PA supported a
reduction in the rate to one-third, i.e., 200 CAF per gram of gold exported through ANEEMAS. The reduction
in the tax rate on gold export, was expected to incentivize
artisanal mining producers to use formal and more secure channels for exports. While the restriction of
mining in forests, wildlife areas and natural waterways sought to mitigate the environmental impact of mining,
especially in areas where mining was previously allowed. PA12 complemented the first part of the PDO on
raising mining productivity through a new pricing policy. That pricing policy would increase discounts offered
to miners from gold collectors (PD2, p. 29), therefore encouraging their incorporation in the formal sector. The
implementation of the pricing policy, however, went through the adoption of a deliberation under PA12, thus
making the enforcement of the new policy somewhat unclear. Relevance of PA11: Satisfactory (S); PA12:
Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA13 and PA14 sought to simplify the registration and formalisation of artisanal mines and strengthen the
national anti-fraud brigade (BNAF). Better management of the sector was crucial to facilitate formalization as
well as to improve the management of precious sources such as water and avoid the deleterious effects of
mining. While water scarcity is expected to increase as a result of climate change, mining contributes to lower
water resources due to pollution. Hence better management of artisanal mines and the organization of miners
is crucial for sustainability purposes. The simplification of artisanal mines’ incorporation in the national
registry went through successive steps, first by encouraging the formation of cooperatives and then
facilitating the management of artisanal control management sites by cooperatives. BNAF was strengthened
through reorganization and better staffing, yet the specific nature of this strengthening was unclear. PA14
adopted two deliberations, one specifying a standard model for site management by cooperatives and a
second enacting the standard convention for artisanal mining site management. Both followed from PA13 and
the improved regulatory framework that allowed ANEEMAS to concede the management of artisanal mining
sites under its control to cooperatives. Moreover, ANEEMAS has adopted standard models for
the management of artisanal mining sites and specifications with environmental and natural capital
preservation standards to be enforced by cooperatives. Registration with ANEEMAS provides several
advantages for cooperative members, including the pooling of the means of production and equipment; of
financial resources to meet legal obligations and acquire efficient, environment-friendly technologies, and
improved opportunity to acquire mining titles and authorizations. As a result, PA14 made a direct and
important contribution to better management of precious resources. Relevance of PA13: Moderately
Satisfactory (MS); PA14: Satisfactory (S).

PA15 and PA16: supported measures to reduce deforestation. Deforestation has become a major challenge
for Burkina Faso with a reduction in forests from 25 percent of all land area in 1990 to 19.3 percent in 2016.
The division of forests between State-owned classified forest and protected forests managed locally by
villages and communes complicated their protection. State forests represent about 40 percent of the forested
area and are subject to risk of deforestation and forest degradation from mining. PA15 clarified the set of
protective measures pertaining to deforestation through the adoption of a regulation and 17 minutes (procès-
verbaux) that awarded a formal state forest protection status to 17 classified forests. The PA extended the

                                                                                                  Page 20 of 37

size of protective status through the regulation and the completion of a geo-referential delimitation of the 17
classified forests (PD2, p.30). The contribution of the minutes to the objective remained unclear, reducing the
PA’s overall relevance.

State forests are protected by decree, but the lack of clear delimitation and registration in the mining and land
cadasters provides an opportunity for other actors to change the land use. The lack of clear boundaries also
weakens law enforcement. PA16 (i) established a data harmonization and sharing between the mining
cadaster and the forestry cadaster, (ii) excluded 16 forests from the mining cadaster, and (iii) registered 5
classified forests in the land cadaster. Through data harmonization between the mining and land cadasters,
this PA complemented the extension of the state forest protection status of PA15 by adding classified forests
to the land cadaster, taking forests out of the mining cadaster database and establishing boundaries between
mining and non-mining areas , While the legal delimitation of state forests is an important step forward, the
protection of state forests and enforcement of protection status are not addressed by the two PAs, as such
protection would have required additional rules, such as specific penalties on violating deforestation and the
banning of mining exports that violate forest delimitation. Relevance of PA15: Moderately Satisfactory
(MS); PA16: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PDO3: Improve livestock productivity, PAs 17-19.

The livestock sector was an important contributor to: (a) about 35 percent of the agricultural GDP; (b) food
and nutrition security; and (c) export income. Improving productivity of the livestock sector is therefore
necessary, not just for rural incomes but for foods security. Livestock productivity is linked to the
management of natural resources and climate-change induced challenges. Since climate change amplifies
the risks of disease occurrence and expansion within animal populations, animal health needs to be
supported, and capacity to manage sanitary crises strengthened. One objective is to prevent, control or
eradicate prevailing transboundary diseases such as Small Ruminant’s Plague (Peste des Petits Ruminants,
PPR). PPR. According to the National Rural Development Sector Program (PNSR), the estimated loss from
PPR outbreaks amounted to about 180 billion CFAF in 2008 and 375 billion CFAF in 2016.

PA17, PA18 and PA19 formed part of the same results chain aiming at a mass Small Ruminants Plague
((Peste des Petits Ruminants, PPR) vaccination campaign to protect vulnerable animals and make livestock
more resilient. PA17 sought to support the public health mandate for private veterinarians to reduce the risk
of disease (PD3, p.26). PA18 supported the adoption the 2020 operational vaccination plan. PA19 made
a direct contribution to the objective by specifying the technical aspects of a mass vaccination campaign.
Relevance of PA17: Satisfactory (S); PA18: Satisfactory (S); PA19: Satisfactory (S).

PDO4: Enhance public service delivery, PAs 20-23

The health sector faced significant challenges despite Burkina Faso having achieved a significant decline in
maternal and child mortality rates. The quality of health services remained poor, and the country lagged most
of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in health sector performance. Almost 65.3 percent of the poorest households
had no access to health services in 2017. In addition, the country was faced with frequent shortages of
essential drugs and inputs due to the fragmentation of the supply chain system.

Constraints included inadequate public financing, inadequate infrastructure and equipment, and insufficient
and sub-optimal deployment of qualified staff, leaving some rural regions understaffed. In 2017, the ratio of
doctors to patients stood at five per 100,000, and the ratio of nurses to patients stood at 41 per 100,000,
which were amongst the lowest ratios in the world. Financial capacity remained a constraint for access to


                                                                                                    Page 21 of 37

health services for the poor population. Moreover, the weak presence of the State, especially outside the
capital, had been aggravating grievances against the State and has been a major driver of conflict. As of
2020, 48 percent of State civil servants were concentrated in the capital region with the other 12 regions
having on average 4.3 percent of civil servants. Violence has been increasing mainly in border regions where
service delivery is affected by weak civil servant presence. Due to the slow and varied pace of de-
concentration, local governments had not received adequate levels of support from regional offices of
Ministries and deconcentrated departments had not consistently succeeded in bringing the public
administration closer to local populations.

PA20 and PA21 supported facilitating the supply of essential drugs in health facilities. Inadequate
infrastructure contributed to poor health quality services (ICR, p. 14), while institutional shortcomings
identified in the Centrale d’achat de médicaments essentiels génériques et des consommables
médicaux (CAMEG) included shortages of essential generic medicines (PD1, p. 31), poor data quality and
access as well as flaws in product quality systems. PA20 contributed to a more inclusive governance system
for CAMEG through the general assembly, while financial controls would be augmented through an audit
committee. This contributed only partially to the objective, however, since the shortcomings identified above
were related less to financial transparency and cost and more to the lack of medicine supply. PA21
contributed directly to the objective by piloting an integrated logistics and management information system to
match demand with efficient supply availability. The order regarding action taken to avoid payment delays
relies on an essentially political procedure, however, since it requires a quarterly review by the Secretary
General of the Ministry, which could lead to potential shortcomings in the efficiency of decision-
making. Relevance of PA20: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU); PA21: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA22: Inadequate equipment as well as the insufficient and suboptimal deployment of qualified staff
contributed to poor health outcomes in Burkina Faso. Moreover, the old logistics management and
information system did not allow efficient planning based on supply and demand. As such, it was a major
obstacle to strategic decision-making, planning, control, and programming. PA22 sought to optimize the use
of available healthcare personnel by undertaking two activities: first, by conducting staff censuses and
second by adopting and operationalizing the WISN methodology, a human resource management tool
adopted by the World Health Organization. The system allows for adequate staff distribution in health
facilities, assesses health workforce workload and uses that data to determine the distribution of staff. This
PA makes a tangible contribution to reaching the objective in a direct way. Relevance of PA22: Satisfactory
(S).

PA23: was adopted in the DPF3 following the refocusing of the operation to tackle drivers of conflict in line
with PNDES II. It built on the reform adopted by PA9, specifically the completion of a staff census within the
Ministry of National Education, Literacy and Promotion of National Languages and the adoption of clear
procedures for personnel redeployment based on needs across territories. The PA entailed the adoption of a
decree of the redeployment at the decentralized and de-concentrated level, which was drafted in consultation
with the labor unions. The Bank has supported this process through the Public Sector Modernization PforR
as well as through ongoing TA financed by the Swedish cooperation and through functional reviews in four
ministries (Education, Health, Civil Service, and Justice). The PA supported an improvement in the state
presence and better service delivery through the establishment of transparent terms and conditions for
assigning civil servants across the territory. The facilitation of transparent staff redeployment on a needs
basis, would contribute to an improvement in the service/population ratios and thus contributing, at least
potentially, to reduced conflict. Relevance of PA23: Satisfactory (S).

 PDO5: Enhance social spending efficiency, PAs 24-26

 Despite several initiatives to aid the vulnerable groups, including food programs, public work programs, a
 cash transfer program initiated in 2014, the adoption of a Law on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in 2015,
 and more than 200 social protection programs overseen by around 20 government agencies and international
 partners, coverage of the cash transfer program was limited (ICR, p. 10). In addition, governance and
 coordination mechanisms were limited, making the existing rudimentary social safety system inefficient. A
 critical bottleneck had been the lack of a social registry. While one fifth of the population nominally benefitted
 from social safety nets, very few programs were pro-poor targeted, making overall social assistance spending
 regressive, since resources tended to benefit those who may not necessarily need them.

 PA24 supported the operationalization of the national fund for universal health insurance (CNAMU), which
 was created in 2018 so as to enable the implementation of the universal health insurance policy (2015). The
 CNAMU was to be funded by social contributions, central government transfers, and other revenues. It will
 play an instrumental role in rationalizing existing free health care schemes and managing the expansion of
 health insurance. CNAMU will be expected to provide insurance coverage of both formal and informal
 sectors, taking over the management of free healthcare schemes (PD1, p. 33). Relevance of PA24:
 Satisfactory (S).

 PA25 and PA26: Establishing a unique social registry is a crucial building block of a national adaptive safety
 net system capable of responding to covariate shocks (PD3, p. 7). PA25 supported the process of identifying
 and registering the poorest quintile of the population (‘indigents’) using harmonized criteria and mechanisms.
 According to the 2014 Social Safety Nets (SSN) assessment, the coverage of those mostly in need in Burkina
 Faso was 2.4 percent. This PA contributed to social spending efficiency by keeping track of beneficiaries and
 their program eligibility, thereby allowing for resource allocation to those genuinely in need and avoiding
 benefits duplication or misuse. PA26 builds on the Covid-19 Crisis-Response DPF (CR-DPF) that supported
 two key reforms relevant for the implementation of a social registry. It contributes directly to the objective by
 establishing the social registry and defining the usage of social programs to facilitate the effective usage of
 the registry. Relevance of PA25: Satisfactory (S); PA26: Satisfactory (S).

households
included in the
social registry

RI1: directly measured the impact of PA1, PA2 and PA3, and entails a clear set of data on baseline and target.
The setup and implementation of a unique tax identification number (PA1), combined with mandatory e-filing of
taxes and e-payment for large firms (PA2) and the simplification of tax filing, especially for micro-enterprises
(PA3) were expected to ease the ability of state authorities to add both individuals and firms to the formal
economy. Relevance of RI1: Satisfactory (S).

RI2: aimed to capture the impact of PA4’s urban registry formation and PA5’s valuation of land and housing on
property tax collection. However, the measure was only moderately relevant for capturing the impact of the
actions since property taxes would be impacted by factors outside the prior actions (including economic growth-
related changes in land values). A better RI would have additionally measured the increase in property
taxpayers, which would have ensured a clearer line of sight between the prior actions and the outcomes.
Relevance of RI2: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI3 measured the impact of PA6 and PA7 on progress toward strengthening the management of public
investment projects. The validation of a feasibility study by a committee, set up for that purpose, enables the
concrete measurement of progress, since the said Committee has created a list of priority investment projects
which are subject to validation by use of environmental risk factors. Relevance of RI3: Moderately
Satisfactory (MS).

RI4: partly measured the impact of PA8, PA9 and PA10 on progress towards containing the growing fiscal
pressures resulting from an increasing public wage bill. It is unclear why the indicator chosen was the nominal
growth of the wage bill, which can vary greatly from year to year, instead of a metric such as share of GDP or
alternative. The wage bill’s evolution is subject to multiple factors beyond the PAs. Relevance of RI4:
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).

RI5: directly measured the impact of PA11, PA12 and PA13, using a clear baseline and target and underpinned
by adequate data. The original target of 2 tons of exports by target year was adjusted downwards in DPF3, and
PD3 notes that this was attributable to delays in export increases caused by the onset of the pandemic.
Relevance of RI5: Satisfactory (S).

RI6 measured the impact of PA16 with reference to registering forests in the land cadaster, which helps ensure
that these forests are not only excluded from mining activities but also from conversion to other land uses.
Calculating the baseline and target is enabled through PA16. Relevance of RI6: Satisfactory (S).

RI7: was added to the series to “measure the climate change mitigation impact” (PD3, p. 56), and was relevant
to the PDO. The ICR clarifies measurement of the RI as well. Relevance of RI7: Satisfactory (S).

RI8: measured progress towards better natural resources management, given that the adoption of natural
capital preservation standards goes through a clearly defined process involving signing a Convention with
ANEEMAS, and the issuance of artisanal mining authorizations by the relevant Ministry that comply with a set of
environmental measures. Relevance of RI8: Satisfactory (S).

  RI9: directly measured progress towards the achievement of the objective, using a clear definition as well as
  credible baseline and target. Relevance of RI9: Satisfactory (S).

  RI10: had been added in DPF3 to “incentivize a stronger focus on women herders and contribute to closing a
  gender gap” (PD3, p. 57). Given the high number of female-led households in need of social spending support, it
  was adequate to capture progress towards the achievement of the objective and used credible baseline data
  and target. Relevance of RI10: Satisfactory (S).

  RI11 had been added in DPF3 and adequately measured the impact of PA23 on progress toward better service
  delivery in an FCV context. In the absence of better service delivery captured by other indicators, however, the
  mere presence of civil servants outside the capital region may not be an adequate measure of the achievement
  of the PDO. Relevance of RI11: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

  RI12: flowed directly from the associated PA that set up WISN to enhance service delivery in the healthcare
  sector. The definition and calculation of the RI was explained in program documentation, but data availability is
  unclear. PD3 reports progress up to 2020, but the ICR mentions no data for the target date of 2022. Relevance
  of RI12: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

  RI13: credibly measured the impact of PA20 and PA21, using credible baseline and target data to capture
  progress towards the objective. Relevance of RI13: Satisfactory (S).

  RI14: directly measured progress towards more efficient social spending and the advancement of health and
  social services to those mostly in need. Both baseline and targets were clear and credible data was available.
  Relevance of RI14: Satisfactory (S).

  RI15: was added in DPF3 “to incentivize a stronger focus on registering female-headed households in the
  social registry” (PD3, p. 59). The indicator captured the gender aspect of the objective on social spending
  efficiency and was premised on credible data pertaining to the relationship of poverty and gender in Burkina
  Faso, as well as the salience of including female-led households in the social registry. Relevance of RI15:
  Satisfactory (S).

RI1: The target of enrolling 170,000 business and individuals in the government’s database was nearly met
by the end of the series, with the introduction of e-filing and e-payment by some firms crucial in DPF1 and
DPF2. Rating: Substantial.

RI2: Property taxes as a share of GDP went up by 60% during the DPF series but did not meet the target of
0.5 percent of GDP. The planned cadaster offices that would assist property tax collection have not been
constructed, and the ICR attributes that to the effects of the pandemic. Rating: Modest.

RI3: The target of public investment projects included in the approved budget that have a feasibility study
validated by the inter-ministerial committee was exceeded by some margin. Rating: High

RI4: The decline in new civil service hirings after 2017 contributed to the substantial decline in the
annual nominal wage growth rate, with 74 percent of the target met by 2022. The rating reflects a downward
adjustment due to the use of nominal wage growth as a measurement indicator, an indicator that is impacted
by many other factors beyond the PA. Rating: Modest.



Rating
Moderately Satisfactory



OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Improve Natural Resources Management [PAs 11-16, RIs 5-8]

Rationale
RI5: The introduction of tax cuts on artisanal mining exports contributed to over-achievement of this indicator,
with 170% of targeted change achieved on the export of artisanal gold mines. Rating: High.

RI6: The prior action pertaining to this indicator focused on determining forest zones and wildlife areas, and in
particular the harmonization of data between the mining and land cadasters. The target of increasing the
hectares of delimited classified forest areas was not achieved. The ICR attributes this partly to the
“deterioration of the internal security situation” (ICR, p. 33) during the operations, as the Environment Ministry
was unable to conduct the required on-site visits required for forest delimitation. Rating: Modest.

RI7: The registration of classified forests allowed for the achievement of the indicator, since the reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions, measured by “carbon sequestration in TCO2eq” (ICR, p. 33) reached 78, 728
tons of CO2 equivalent against a target of 60,000 tons. Rating: High.

RI8: The number of formalized artisanal mining sites increased from 0 at the start of the series to 12 by March
2023, partially achieving the target. Similar to RI6, the deteriorating security situation impacted the
achievement of the target, since many artisanal mining sites are located in areas with an increased security
risk. Rating: Modest.

establishment of a vaccination subsidy mechanism and the incorporation of private actors in the process
Rating: Substantial.

RI10: The target of increasing the share of women-owned small ruminants vaccinated against PPR from 25
percent in 2019 to 35 percent in 2022 was achieved. The indicator reflected the desire to prioritize female
herders so they can access government vaccination services. Rating: High.



Rating
Satisfactory



OBJECTIVE 4
Objective
Enhance Public Service Delivery [PAs 20-23, RIs 11-13]

Rationale
RI11: Following the adoption of a decree of the redeployment of civil service personnel outside the capital
region, which was drafted in consultation with the labor unions, the target was exceeded. The percentage of
civil servants outside the capital rose from 52 percent in 2020 to 73.4 percent by end of the operation. Rating:
High.

RI12: The ICR mentions that the proportion of rural primary health care facilities that meet minimum WISN
standards entails no data to monitor progress “due to dysfunctions in the related database” (ICR, p. 33). This
ICRR uses data available in PD3, which reports an increase from 21 percent in 2017 to 27 percent in 2020
(PD3, p.28) and takes this percentage to be valid by the end of the series. Rating: Modest.

RI13: The target on the proportion of healthcare facilities experiencing shortages of listed essential drugs
deteriorated from 87 percent in 2018 to 94.9 percent in June 2023. The ICR attributes this to the precarious
security situation and the associated difficulty in drugs transportation. As an added data point and with

      BF DPO1 (P166298)




Rationale

The Satisfactory rating for relevance of PAs was based on their sound design to build on initiatives and lessons
from previous analytical work and country engagement and, in most cases, to carry the agenda forward in
successive, manageable steps. The rationale for each action was generally well articulated.

The Satisfactory rating for efficacy resulted from 10 out of 15 targets being either fully achieved or partially
achieved. On fiscal management, substantial progress was made in getting more firms and taxpayers to
become part of the government’s database, thereby enhancing state capacity in fiscal matters and reducing the
size of the informal economy. Property tax collection made partial progress, and the relevance of indicators on
measuring progress regarding public investment projects and the public sector wage growth bill led to a
downward adjustment of efficacy in PDO1. On natural resources management, important progress on
artisanal gold mining exports and partial progress on registering them formally was combined with modest
outcomes pertaining to forests’ protection. Livestock productivity targets related to PPR vaccination were met,
and enhanced state presence by civil servants outside the capital region has been achieved too. Health
outcomes on aggregate improved during the series, although the targets set by the DPFs on generic drug
medicines availability and more primary health care facilities in rural areas were undermined by the precarious
security situation and were largely not met. Social spending efficiency was enhanced through the setup and
effective deployment of the social registry. With relevance of PAs rated as Satisfactory and efficacy as
Satisfactory, the overall outcome is rated Satisfactory.


a. Rating

Satisfactory

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The security situation in Burkina Faso deteriorated during the implementation of the series and has contributed
to suboptimal outcomes with respect to the land cadaster and the registration of artisanal mines. Violent conflict
and political instability pose a major threat to the sustainability of outcomes achieved under the series, especially
regarding property tax collection, public service delivery and the management of natural resources and mining
sites. The fragile security environment in the country could potentially exacerbate shortcomings in service
delivery in the healthcare sector, especially pertaining to drug availability outside the capital and the mobility of
healthcare personnel in rural areas. The government’s reliance on NGOs and community health workers (ICR,
p. 23) for service delivery, instead of administrative staff withdrawn due to security concerns, underlines the risk.

The country’s external vulnerability regarding the international price of both gold and oil also pose risks: the
lowering of internationally traded gold prices could undermine progress in exports and thus affect the country’s
fiscal balance, while a spike in the price of oil could undermine progress made in recent years in Burkina Faso’s
balance of trade and therefore necessitate renewed fiscal commitments.

Progress achieved on property tax collection may prove short-lived unless the construction and
operationalization of planned cadaster offices can proceed as originally envisaged. Additional resources

deployed for the PPR vaccination campaign have led to a successful outcome, yet the sustainability of that
success hinges on the continued participation of the private sector through service provision.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Analytical Underpinnings: Further to the SCD (2017) and the CPF (FY18-23), the DPF series was strongly
backed by a combination of technical reports, IPFs and TA.

The rationale and design of Pillar 1 was largely based on IMF and World Bank analytical underpinnings prior and
during the operation of the series. On tax administration, the series was based on the World Bank’s 2019 West
Africa Tax Study, which underlined the salience of generalizing electronic procedures for filing and paying taxes
as key to improving public administration. On domestic revenue mobilization, the series utilized the “Case
Studies in Tax Revenue Mobilization in Low-Income Countries” completed by the IMF in 2019, which
demonstrated the link between low domestic revenue mobilization and the tax system. On public spending
efficiency, the 2017 joint IMF-World Bank PIMA Report highlighted the main weaknesses of Public Investment
Management in Burkina Faso, and the Burkina Faso Wage Bill Management and Civil Service Reform (IMF,
2018) identified directions to contain the wage bill.

On Pillar 2 pertaining to artisanal mining, the series drew on the 2016 mining sector policy note of the World
Bank to favor an approach that integrates non-state actors to raise productivity, while on livestock the series
benefited from the World Bank’s 2018 Burkina Faso‐ Study on Agro‐processing Opportunities, that stressed how
meat exports went through controlling transboundary diseases, the 2019 Burkina Faso Rural Income Diagnostic
on income losses incurred due to low PPR vaccination rates, and the 2020 Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture
Investment Plan for Burkina Faso, completed by the World Bank, the government and development partners. On
deforestation, the series benefited from the World Bank’s 2021 Burkina Faso Country Forest Note.

On Pillar 3, the series drew on the World Health Organization’s Workload Indicators of Staffing Needs (WISN)
method, the Eligibility Note for Access to the PRA for Burkina Faso (World Bank, 2020), which highlighted
challenges in service delivery and local governance, the World Bank’s Safety Net Assessment of 2019 that
called for measures to make social spending mor efficient and the 2020 World Bank Poverty Assessment that
pointed to large gender gaps in poverty that exacerbate female vulnerability to income shocks.

Results Chain: the rationale for each policy action was extensively discussed but not always adequately
documented. PD1 included a detailed discussion as to the substance of each prior action, its rationale and its
link to the indicative trigger associated with it in the foreseen DPF2, and the same is true for PD2. PD3
articulated a coherent set of issues, measures, and anticipated results for each action. The ICR included a table
devoted to the theory of change pursued in the operation (p. 18) but did not discuss any critical assumptions
underpinning the series. The relationship between PAs and the intended outcomes was evident in most cases.

Risk identification and mitigation: PD2 correctly assessed the political and governance risks as high, raising it
from substantial during appraisal of the DPF1. Given the progressively deteriorating security situation during the

series documented in the ICR and PD3, it is unclear why DPF3 downgraded the political risk to substantial,
since it mentions the deteriorating security situation and aggravated social tensions. Mitigation measures on
political and governance risks were limited to technical capacity assistance and ongoing dialogue with
government authorities to ensure widespread societal representation in reforms and the effective delivery of
services. It is not fully clear why the environmental and social risks were downgraded from substantial to
moderate in the last operation of the series, (ICR, p. 37). While PAs and triggers for the social registry were
progressing well, and the implementation of the Iterative Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM) governance framework (a
key ex-post governance measure to ensure the proper implementation of cash transfers to the multiple
beneficiaries) was a useful mitigation measure, the same was not true for environmental risks. The setting up of
an e-cadaster and the separation between the mining and land cadasters in a context of more frequent climate
shocks remained core challenges. The technical design risk was upgraded from moderate in the first two
operations to substantial in the third. The ICR argues that this likely underestimated the risk inherent in some of
the PA implementation regarding the PPR vaccination campaign, yet the argument appears more related to the
macroeconomic implications of state subsidies offered to carry out the campaign than the technical aspect
of vaccination. Technical risks were correctly mitigated through technical assistance.

Coordination with development partners: the World Bank leads the Economic Governance sectorial dialogue
in charge of monitoring macroeconomic reforms and budget support programs, part of the fourteen sectorial
dialogues the Government set up in the context of its development program. In designing the proposed
operation, the World Bank consulted with the IMF, the AfDB, the EU, the French Agency for Development and
the Danish Development Agency. As part of these consultations, the World Bank completed a Prevention and
Peace Building Assessment (PPBA) that aims to identify opportunities to promote peace and maintain social
cohesion in Burkina Faso. Cooperation with the IMF has been particularly close on the wage bill agenda and
includes longer term policy reforms, such as the adoption of a new public service organic law and the adoption
of a harmonized pay scale.

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Monitoring and coordination with partners: The Bank’s sector teams provided ad hoc assistance to the
Government’s own M&E system to help define indicators and their measurement, especially on deforestation
and environmental management. The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Development was the designated
implementing agency and the World Bank worked closely with the Directorate General of Cooperation
(DGCOOP). WB staff monitored progress on the ground and virtually due to the onset of the pandemic as well
as the deteriorating security situation. Coordination with the IMF was extensive in the context of outcomes
associated with the first objective and the government in the context of the reform dialogue process that lasted
for most of the series. A Bank DPF TTL chaired the Public Financial Management (PFM) donor group during a

                                                                                                     Page 34 of 37

significant part of the DPF series implementation, and coordination with the IMF entailed both the macro level,
but also key reform sectors such as social protection and climate change.

Adaptation: in important respects, the Bank adapted quickly and efficiently amidst a rapidly changing context
during the series. Prior actions in DPF2 pertaining to fiscal management and public investment projects were
strengthened to reflect substantial progress resulting from the first operation and aimed to raise the series’
developmental ambitions. To illustrate, when it came clear that a new organic law related to civil service could
not be adopted without a new Constitution, the team adjusted the program to contain the growth of wage bill, by
i) adopting an order (arrêté) that improved the transparency and rationalized motivation bonuses to staff of the
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Development and ii) completing nominative and geographic staff censuses
to redeploy 11,757 education professionals. The onset of the pandemic led to adjustments in the results
framework for both DPF2 and DPF3, while COVID-19 also triggered the launch of a standalone DPF. Ongoing
political uncertainty also led to a major update in DPF3 that included important indicators on PDOs 4 and 5.

9. Other Impacts

a. Social and Poverty

DPF3 included a rather detailed discussion as to the expected social impact of DPF3 prior actions, without
including any projected ex-ante breakdown of the expected welfare gains by the operation. DPF2 also included
a detailed text (Annex 7) as to some of the welfare losses associated with the onset of the pandemic, especially
pertaining to income losses for the rural population and the anticipated deterioration in health outcomes. The
extreme poverty rate, measured by the US$1.9 a day (2011 PPP) poverty line, was estimated at 38 percent in
2019, and both PD3 and the ICR suggest that the pandemic is estimated, based on simulations, to have
boosted the extreme poverty rate by one percentage point. Poverty decreased from 39.9 percent in 2017 to
32.3 percent in 2022, but the ICR underlines that the downward trend was reversed due to the pandemic.

The series did not anticipate a noteworthy environmental impact at design stage. PD3 discussed some expected
positive impact of the PAs associated with natural resources management, without concrete data. No
noteworthy impact was identified ex-post.



c. Gender

The operation was not originally designed to have any specific gender effects. However, DPF3 added two result
indicators (RI10 and RI15) focusing on vaccinating small ruminants owned by women and targeting female-led
household inclusion in the social registry, which would contribute to greater equity in improved livestock
productivity and social spending efficiency advances.

10. Quality of ICR

Rationale

The ICR provides a compact summary of the context at appraisal and rationale for the series and discusses the
evolution of the PDOs. It also offers a coherent narrative of the series, the changes that occurred during the
series as well as the results. The ICR discusses all prior actions and their evolution in an analytical Table. The
theory of change (results chain) is also outlined through a Table and a brief section on context suggests the
complementarities between series objectives. There is also rich information on analytical underpinnings, context,
and a few data points. ICR evidence is generally of high quality with relevance to PAs for both Pillars, although
many PAs are grouped together and the discussion of the evidence linking outcomes with interventions is
occasionally very brief. The results chain is divided into each of the pillars of the operation. The efficacy section
(Achievement of Objectives) is in line with ICR Guidelines but rather short. Not all results indicators are
adequately discussed. The sections on other outcomes, Bank performance and risks are in line with ICR
Guidelines. Lessons are divided in general and FCV-context lessons and quite detailed.

12. Lessons

IEG agrees with the ICR lesson stressing the importance of reform ownership from the outset to deliver positive
results. Progress achieved on fiscal management, despite several challenges that emerged during operations,
appears strongly linked to government ownership of reforms on the fiscal front and the maintaining of
institutional memory in the Ministry of Finance during earlier operations. Such continuity can allow for
momentum to be maintained during challenging phases in a series, linked to either external or internal events.

Complex and long-lasting series need to take political feasibility variables, and the potential for political
instability, more into account at the design stage. This can indeed help improve future operations and their policy
programs design. This is especially important in an FCV country context: the DPFs were designed on the back
of extensive analytical work underlining that political stability had only recently been achieved in the country
and a large part of the series was premised on the unspoken assumption of a lack of deterioration, if not
improvement, going forward. The design of the Series could have incorporated this key political economy
variable more strongly in both design and subsequent implementation to maximize impact on development
outcomes.

In an FCV context, the scale of ambition should match realities on the ground and inform both design and
implementation. Overt reliance on government orders and decision-making is likely to have less of a
developmental impact in situations where effective governance mechanisms are absent and policy
implementation remains the primary reform obstacle. Aligning program design, especially PAs and triggers,
more with existing data and relying less on government decrees could maximize the Bank’s impact on the
ground.
