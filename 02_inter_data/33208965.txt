c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates 
The program consisted of three Programmatic Development Policy Finance Operations (DPF) for Fiscal Consolidation, Sustainable Energy and Competitiveness. The total amount approved for the program was US$3.15 billion, of which US$1.0 billion each for DPF1 and DP2 and US$1.15 billion for DP3. The loans were fully disbursed. DPF1, DPF2 and DPF3 were approved on December 17th of 2015, December 20th of 2016 and December 5th  of 2017; and closed on June 30th of 2017, 2018 and 2019 as scheduled. 
3. Relevance of Design 


a. Relevance of Objectives 
The program pursued objectives of high relevance and sought to solve entrenched problems that had slowed down growth and portended more economic trouble ahead if left unsolved. The government had to address them: to grow faster, to reduce poverty, and to prevent a rise in economic and social tensions. By 2014, actual government expenditure and revenue were 33.4 and 21.7 percent of GDP and its primary balance and total cash deficits were 3.9 and 11.6 percent of GDP; excluding exceptional receipts and payments, the underlying deficit was 16.7 percent of GDP. Interest payments, wages, salaries, and subsidies, grants and social transfers (subsidies, for short) accounted for 83 percent of total expenditure; since 2011 these expenses had grown by 5.4 percentage points of GDP, more than the growth of total expenditure (4.1 percentage points of GDP). Energy subsidies (about 2/3 of total subsidies) accounted for 7 percent of GDP. There was little room left for investment in physical assets (e.g., transport, water and sanitation) and for support to health and education programs that could raise human capital and spur growth. Other factors shackled growth: poor electricity services and frequent blackouts; large distortions in relative prices, especially in energy, and regulations to private sector activities that numbed its potential for creating wealth. Solving these problems was a goal of the government�s reform agenda, which was framed around four themes: macro-fiscal stabilization, private sector-led growth, transparency and accountability, and social an economic inclusion (Program document for DPF1, p. 28). 

The program�s objectives were also consistent with the CPF FY15-FY19 objectives, specifically with the five objectives of Focus Area 1 (improved governance), with objectives 1 and 2 of Focus Area 2 (improved opportunities for private sector job creation) and with objective 5 (increase household access to natural gas) of Focus Area 3 (social inclusion). The objectives were also coherent with solving the issues raised in the World Bank�s Systematic Country Diagnostic of Egypt (September 2015): long standing structural budget and trade deficits; growth was not sustained nor inclusive; energy subsidies deteriorated the fiscal position, discouraged labor intensive production and increased insiders� privileges; poor public governance resulted in poor sectoral governance along multiple dimensions with widespread harmful consequences. 
b. Relevance of Prior Actions 

Rationale 
Pillar 1. Fiscal Consolidation 
PA#1 � #PA2. Enhancing Government Revenue-The relevance of PA#1�PA#2 is Satisfactory 
The prior action sought to increase revenue from income taxes by (a) eliminating disparities in the top income tax rates for all economic actors, paving the way for a stable and predictable income tax policy and (b) solving taxation disputes that prevented the government from collecting the generalized sales tax. The legislation unified the top income tax rates at 22.5 percent, thereby treating equally all economic agents and all economic activities falling in that bracket; the reform raised the rate for those who received special treatment and eliminated the incentives to request special treatment. The legislation on disputes made it easier and more efficient to solve them and deal with a backlog of cases; the resolution was final and would not be needed for the future as a new law replaced the Generalized Sales Tax (GST) for a value added tax (VAT) and clarified the tax treatment of several areas that were not clear in the GST legislation. 
PA#3 � PA#6. Containing the Wage Bill. The relevance of PA#3 �PA#6 is Highly Satisfactory. 
The prior actions sought to contain the wage bill by addressing the (a) uncontrolled growth of nominal wages, bonuses and rewards; and (b) subpar management of the government�s payments systems. The budget legislation limited the growth of nominal wages and separated the payment of bonuses and rewards from wage payments. The legislation also supported the automation of wage payments, giving the government more control over them and better information on the structure and level of wages across staff and agencies. 

PA #7 � PA#11. Strengthening Debt Management and Aspects of Public Financial Management. The relevance of PA#7�PA#11 is Satisfactory. 
The prior actions sought to reduce the costs and risks of debt by addressing shortcomings in its management caused by: (a) relying on relatively short maturity financing; (b) poor accounting and measurement of debt risks; (c) lack of independent risk-based internal audits and (d) lack of information on the effectiveness of public sector governance, risk management and internal controls. The prior actions sought to provide more information and transparency to the market by publishing a medium-term management strategy which required building capacity in Ministry of Finance to prepare debt strategies and carry out internal audits using international standards. 
With two groups of PA satisfactory and one group highly satisfactory, the relevance of prior actions in Pillar 1 is Satisfactory. 

Pillar 2. Sustainable Energy Supply 
PA#12 � PA#17. Reforming Energy Subsidies. The relevance of PA#12-PA#17 is Highly Satisfactory. 
The prior actions sought to reduce the fiscal cost of subsidies in gas, fuel and electricity and achieve full cost recovery in the power sector by attacking its causes: low tariffs and large divergence between them and the underlying costs of producing power. The prior actions consisted of raising tariffs, recovering costs and addressing the budgetary impact of changes in the exchange rate and the external prices of gas and oil. 
PA#18 � PA#22. Improving Energy Governance. The relevance of PA#18-PA#21 is Highly Satisfactory. 
The prior actions sought to promote competition in the electricity sector and the efficient operation and expansion of capacity of the power sector by addressing the monopoly power of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company and the insufficient autonomy and accountability of the electricity regulator. The prior actions consisted of: (a) separating the transmission, generation and distribution services; (b) strengthening the regulatory capacity of the State over the sector and (c) empowering consumers of electricity. 
PA#23 � PA#31. Accelerating the Low Carbon Energy Transition . The relevance of PA# 23-PA#31 is Satisfactory. 
The sub-pillar had a different name in each DPF. Some of the prior actions in sub-pillar 2.2 of DP2 appeared as prior actions in DPF3 in sub-pillar 2.3; for this review they have been classified in sub-pillar 2.3. 
The prior actions sought to address the problems that prevented using a larger share of renewables in the production of electricity. The problems were the monopoly of production and distribution in the gas market of Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, the absence of a regulatory agency to set the rules for competition in the gas sector, inadequate management, governance and transparency in the sector, government ownership of investment in renewables, concerns about the levels of the feed-in tariff for solar energy and the high risks and lack of incentives for investing in wind power and solar photovoltaics. 

The prior actions addressed these problems by (a) opening the downstream gas sector to private investors, 
(b) opening access to the gas infrastructure, (c) establishing an independent gas regulator, (d) issuing a law that stimulates the production of electricity from renewable resources, (e ) revising the feed-in tariff policy for renewable energy, (f) issuing interim licenses to private developers and approving the use of competitive auctions to allocate licenses for private sector-owned renewable energy capacity and (g) building the capacity and the institutional infrastructure in the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy to spearhead the modernization of the petroleum sector and lead the implementation of the action plan for National Energy Efficiency. 
With two groups of PA highly satisfactory and one group satisfactory the relevance of prior actions in Pillar 2 is Satisfactory. 

Pillar 3. Business Environment 
PA#32 � #PA36. Improving the Investment Regime and its Transparency. The relevance of PA# 32�PA#36 is Highly Satisfactory. 
The program sought to address the problems of incentives for investment arising from: (a) inconsistencies between the laws on income tax (2005) and investment guarantee and incentives (1997); (b) deficiencies in the regime for investors right and protection; (c) the unclear role of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) in facilitating investments; (d) unlimited liability for single-person companies; (e) cumbersome licensing procedures and lack of transparency and information in licensing, investment incentives and eligibility criteria. The prior actions aimed to address the problem through: (a) amendments in the Companies Law to provide limited liability protection for single-person companies; (b) amendments in the investment law that, among others, defined conditions and procedures for not approving licenses, designated GAFI as the sole interface with investors for certain activities, and granted investors the rights to establish and expand investment projects and to gain and transfer profits; (c) institutional reforms to improve services to investors such as better quality and transparency of information and online automated and integrated registration services. 
1. Reforming Industrial Licensing. The relevance of PA# 37-PA#39 is Moderately Satisfactory. 
The licensing regime �in place since 1950 and revised several times in an inconsequential manner� impeded the industrial development of Egypt. Few firms managed to complete the process to get a license. The program addressed the issue through three prior actions: (a) announcing the reform program and setting the principles of the reform; (b) the Cabinet approving a draft law of the reform and submitting it to Parliament; and (c) the Ministry of Industry and Trade adopting a plan to implement the reforms after Parliament approves the law. 
PA#40�PA#46. Strengthening the Competition Framework. The relevance of PA# 40-PA#46 is Satisfactory. 
Egypt ranked low among comparator countries in the classification of the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR), and its rank reached its nadir in 2014. Its Competition Law did not promote competition, for which reason it was amended in 2014. The amendments helped improve competition, but the authorities had to take further actions to increase the likelihood that the Egyptian economy could be more competitive. The program supported these actions through prior actions aimed at (a) strengthening the institutional independence of the Egyptian Competition Authority (ECA); (b) issuing legislation to carry out the government�s anti-cartel policy; and (c) ECA adopting secondary legislation to implement the Competition 

Law in matters related to (i) exemptions, (ii) leniency, (iii) fines and (iv) assessing the impact of laws on competition. 
With one group of PA highly satisfactory, other group satisfactory and other moderately satisfactory the relevance of prior actions of Pillar 3 is Satisfactory. 


Rating 
Satisfactory 
4. Relevance of Results Indicators 
Rationale 
Pillar 1. Fiscal Consolidation 
1.1. Enhancing Government Revenues 
. RI# 1 from prior actions #1 and #2. The relevance of RI#1 is Satisfactory. 
Increased non-sovereign corporate income tax and sales/VAT on goods and services as a percentage of GDP: 6.7% in 2017/18  (Baseline: 5.4% in FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and the information can be obtained. The indicator measures the combined revenue from reforms in the income and value added taxes and is appropriate for that purpose. The indicator does not inform about the revenue-effect of each reform, which could be useful to know their separate contribution to the change in total revenue. 


1.2. Containing the Wage Bill 
. RI#2 from prior actions #3-#6. The relevance of RI#2 is Satisfactory. 
Reduction of the ratio of the Central Government�s wage and salary bill to nominal GDP: 7.4 percent of GDP by FY2017/18 (Baseline: 8.2 percent of GDP in FY2014/15). The indicator is adequate for its purpose, it can be measured and the information can be obtained. 

1.3. Strengthening Debt Management and Aspects of Public Financial Management. 
. RI#3 from prior action #7. The relevance of RI#1 is Moderately Unsatisfactory. 
Completion of at least four audits on sectors and entities affiliated with the Ministry of Finance: 4 or more by FY2017/18 (Baseline: none). The number of reports completed can be measured. It is unclear if the reports can be obtained and how just having them strengthens debt and public financial management. The indicator does not measure the strength of debt management or public financial management and thus limits its likelihood for impact. 
. RI#4 from prior actions #8-#11.  The relevance of RI#4 is Moderately Unsatisfactory. 

Publication of an updated Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy by FY2017/18 (Baseline: none). Publishing a strategy provides information about the course of debt management but having a text is insufficient to conclude that debt management and aspects of public financial management strengthened. 
The relevance of the results indicators for Pillar 1 is Moderately Satisfactory. 
Pillar 2. Sustainable Energy Supply 

2.1 �Reforming energy subsidies 
. RI#5 from prior actions #12-#17. The relevance of RI#5 is Satisfactory. 
Reduction of energy subsidies as a percentage of GDP: 3.2% in FY2017/18  (Baseline: 6.6% in FY2013/14). The indicator can be measured, can be obtained and is appropriate to measure the impact of the reform. Like RI#1 and RI#2 its fulfillment depends on the behavior of nominal GDP; in this particular case it also depends on exogenous factors like the international prices of oil and gas. 

2.2 �Improving Energy Governance 
. RI#6 from prior actions $18-#21. The relevance of RI#6 is Highly Satisfactory. 
Notification and operationalization of supply code and transmission tariff by FY2017/18 (Baseline: none). The indicator can be measured and obtained and is appropriate to assess energy governance. It is unclear if the indicator refers to wholesale or retail supply code. Having a supply code serves several purposes, among others �provide for recovery of electricity charges, intervals for billing of electricity charges, disconnection of supply of electricity for non-payment thereof, restoration of supply of electricity, measures for preventing tampering, �.� The Electricity Supply Code | Electricity Act | Bare Acts | Law Library | AdvocateKhoj. 
. RI#7 from prior actions #18-#21. The relevance of RI#7 is Highly Satisfactory. 
Reduced difference between peak electricity demand and available peak capacity: surplus of 1,000 MW by FY2017/18 (Baseline: deficit of 5,540 MW in FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and obtained. Other definitions and measures of security are used for other contexts (See, for example, Global Energy Institute | U.S. Chamber of Commerce). For the case at hand the indicator is appropriate. 
. RI#8 from prior actions #22. The relevance of RI#8 is Satisfactory. 
Public disclosure of tariff methodology for computation of electricity tariffs. (Baseline: none). The indicator can be measured and obtained. Disclosing the methodology increases transparency in tariff policy and can help develop and maintain a tariff structure that encourages an efficient use of resources. Transparency does not guarantee an efficient use of resources, as interest groups may mold the tariff structure for their benefit. 
The relevance of the results indicator for Pillar 2 is Satisfactory. 

2.3 � Accelerating the Low Carbon Energy Transition 
. RI#9 from prior actions #23, #24. The relevance of RI#9 is Satisfactory. 

Publication of a separate gas transmission tariff, transmission code, market rules, and approval procedures by FY2018/19 (Baseline: none). The indicator can be measured and obtained. Publishing that information raises transparency in the sector, makes the rules clear to all participant and is likely to help bring more competition into the market. Alone, the result is unlikely to accelerate the transition to low carbon energy. 
. RI#10 from prior actions #23, #24, #25  � Accelerating the Low Carbon Energy Transition. The relevance of RI#10 is Satisfactory. 
Launching of a dedicated web portal with all gas sector rules and regulations: FY2018/19 (Baseline: none). The indicator can be measured and obtained. As noted in RI#9 above, more and better information brings more transparency to the market and is likely to bring more competition. Alone, the result is unlikely to accelerate the transition to low carbon energy as other variables affect the speed at which renewable energy is produced. 
. RI#11 from prior actions #26, #27, #28, #29  � Accelerating the Low Carbon Energy Transition. The relevance of RI#11 is Highly Satisfactory. 
Financial closure of private sector-owned renewable energy projects: 1,500 MW end of FY2017/18. (Baseline: 0 MW (October 2015). The indicator can be measured and obtained. Reaching financial closure constitutes a fundamental step to start the transition. 
. RI#12 from prior actions #30, #31. � Accelerating the Low Carbon Energy Transition. The relevance of RI#12 is Satisfactory. 
Increase in the number of energy audits performed for large consumer and government buildings to 234 in FY2018/19 (Baseline: 134 in FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and verified. An energy audit looks at current energy consumption in a building or a home and identifies energy efficiency measures that can be adopted to make it more efficient. A checklist is used to assess energy efficiency based on equipment, appliances, design, and usage. While the information may be useful, it is unclear how the information gathered will lead large consumers to adopt energy efficient measures. 
The relevance of the results indicators for Pillar 2 is Satisfactory. 
Pillar 3. Business Environment 

3.1 �Improving the Investment Regime and Its Transparency, particularly for MSMEs 
. RI#13 from prior actions #32-#34 The relevance of RI#13 is Satisfactory. 
Increase in business entry, as measured by the average number of company registrations at GAFI Investor Service Centers per month: 65 percent higher in FY2017/18 over its baseline value (Baseline: 867 average registrations per month in  FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and can be obtained. It is unclear if it refers to newly created businesses or established informal businesses that register. 
. RI#14 from prior actions #34-#36. The relevance of RI#14 is Satisfactory. 
Increase in the number of GAFI Investor Services Centers offering automated and integrated registration services for companies under both the Investment and Companies Laws: 4 by the end of FY2017/18 (Baseline: 

0 in FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and can be obtained. Initially the indicator was to measure the accessibility of single-person companies to registration services; in its final form it refers to all companies. 

3.2 � Reforming Industrial Licensing 
. RI#15 from prior actions #37-#39. The relevance of RI#15 is Moderately Satisfactory. 
Average number of days to issue an industrial license by notification: no more than 7 days by the end of FY2017/18 (Baseline: none). The indicator can be measured and can be obtained. It is unclear why the indicator is an average; it should be a cap and it should apply to each company or person requesting the license. 
. RI#16 from prior actions #37-#39. The relevance of RI#16 is Moderately Satisfactory. 
Reduction in the average number of days to comply with all industrial licensing requirements:  160 days by the end of FY2017/18 (Baseline: 634 days in FY2014/15). The indicator can be measured and can be obtained. It is unclear why it is an average and not a cap. It serves to gauge if industrial licensing becomes less cumbersome on average. If achieved, it does not inform how much of a drag industrial licensing is on businesses. 

3.3 � Strengthening the Competition Framework 
. RI#17 from prior actions #40-#46. The relevance of RI#16 is Satisfactory. 
Increase in the number of anti-competitive practices prevented/eliminated: though 11 was the original target, the Egyptian Competition Authority issued 17 decisions during the relevant period (Baseline: 9 between FY2012/13 and FY2014/15). This implies a 70% increase in the number of anti-competitive practices eliminated. The indicator is useful, can be easily measured, and captures trends in reform. Importantly, it also illustrates progress against anti-competitive behavior in key sectors of the economy. 
Thus, the relevance of the results indicators for Pillar 3 is Satisfactory. 
The overall relevance of the results indicators for the three pillars is Satisfactory. There is considerable variation in the likely effectiveness of the proposed RIs and the large number make it difficult to concentrate on the factors that will ultimately have the biggest impact on government reform. But there are some useful and important measures here illustrative of impact.

5. Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy) 
OBJECTIVE 1 


Objective 

Advance fiscal consolidation 

Rationale 
Under this objective the program supported intervention in three areas: enhancing government revenues, containing the wage bill,  and strengthening debt management and aspects of public financial management for which there were mixed results. 
Government revenue. The expected result was to increase non-sovereign corporate income tax and sales/VAT tax on goods and services from 5.4 percent of GDP on December 15, 2015, to about 6.7 percent in FY2017/18. Actual result: 6.6 percent of GDP on June 30, 2019. The IMF�s Country Report No. 21/7 of January 2021 informs that in FY2018/19 tax revenue from the corporate income tax and from the VAT and non-oil excises was 3.1 and 5.8 percent of GDP, amounting to a combined 8.9 percent of GDP. The result was achieved per ICR data and exceeded per more recent IMF data. Rating: Highly Satisfactory. 
Wage bill. The expected result was to reduce the ratio of the Central Government�s wage and salary bill to nominal GDP to 7.4% of GDP by FY2017/18. Actual result: 5 percent of GDP in June 2019. The result was exceeded by a large margin. Rating: Highly Satisfactory. 
Debt management and aspects of public financial management. The expected results were to: (a) complete at least four audits on sectors and entities affiliated with the Ministry of Finance by FY2017/18; and 
(b) publishing an updated Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy by FY2017/18. The four audits were completed in February 2020, a delay in part caused by difficulties in hiring a head for the internal audit unit in the Ministry of Finance. The Debt Strategy had been published by June 30, 2019. The review considers both results achieved, despite the eight-month delay in completing the audit. Achieving the two results does not guarantee that debt management and public financial management improved and that fiscal consolidation was enhanced because of the results achieved. The indicators cannot answer the question: did fiscal consolidation happen because the two indicators were achieved? Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory. 
Rating 
Satisfactory 
OBJECTIVE 2 

Objective 
Ensure sustainable energy supply 

Rationale 
Under this objective the program supported interventions in three areas: energy subsidies, energy governance, accelerating transition to low carbon energy. 

Energy subsidies. The expected result was to reduce energy subsidies as a percentage of GDP from 6.6 percent in FY2013/14 to 3.2 percent in FY2017/18. The actual result was 2.0 percent of GDP on June 30, 2019. The result was exceeded by a substantial margin. 
Energy governance. Three results were expected: 
. 
To have notification and operationalization of supply code and transmission tariff by FY2017/18. The result was achieved at completion of program. 

. 
To reduce the difference between the peak electricity demand and the available peak capacity from a deficit of 5,540 MW in FY2014/15 to a surplus of 1,000 MW by FY2017/18. The actual result was exceeded by a large margin. The difference was 24.6 gigawatts (GW), 25 times larger than the target. The large surplus was driven by lower consumption in response to higher electricity tariffs and a large increase in the supply of electricity coming from big investments in building new plants to ensure long�term security of supply. 

. 
Public disclosure of tariff methodology for the computation of electricity tariffs by FY2018/19. That was achieved by end of FY18. Disclosing the methodology is a step forward but does not ensure that governance improved. 


Transition to low carbon energy. Four results were expected: 
. 
Publication of a separate gas transmission tariff, transmission code, market rules, and approval procedures by FY2018/19. The result was achieved by June 30, 2019. 

. 
Launching of a dedicated web portal with all gas sector rules and regulations by FY2018/19. The result was achieved by June 30, 2019. 

. 
Financial closure of private sector-owned renewable energy projects from 0 MW (October 2015) to 1,500 MW (end of FY2017/18). The result was achieved by June 30, 2019. 

. 
Increase in the number of energy audits performed for large consumer and government buildings from 134 in FY2014/15 to 234 in FY2018/19. The result was achieved by June 30, 2019. Achieving the target does not inform if the consumers improved their energy efficiency, but overall progress was Satisfactory. 


Rating 
Satisfactory 
OBJECTIVE 3 


Objective 
Enhance the business environment 

Rationale 
Under this objective the program supported interventions in three areas: improving the investment regime and its transparency, reforming industrial licensing, and strengthening the competition framework. 

Investment regime. The expected results were: 
. 
Increase in business entry, as measured by the average number of company registrations at GAFI Investor Service Centers per month. The increase was to be 65% in FY2017/18 over the baseline of 867 average registrations per month in  FY2014/15.The actual number was 2027 company registrations by June 30, 2019, more than doubling the target. 

. 
Increase in the number of GAFI Investor Services Centers offering automated and integrated registration services for companies under both the Investment and Companies Laws, from 0 in FY2014/15 to 4 by the end of FY2017/18. The actual number of centers offering these services was 11 by June 30, 2019, more than doubling the target. 


Industrial licensing. The expected results were: 
. 
Average number of days to issue an industrial license by notification of no more than 7 days by the end of FY2017/18. The actual number of days by June 30, 2019 was five, exceeding the target. Rating: High 

. 
Reduction in the average number of days to comply with all industrial licensing requirements from 634 days in FY2014/15 to 160 days by the end of FY2017/18. The number of days fell to 55 by June 30, 2019, exceeding the target by a large margin. 


Competition framework. The expected results were: 
. Increase in the number of anti-competitive practices prevented/eliminated from a baseline of 9 (between FY2012/13 and FY2014/15) to a target of 11 decided during theFY16-18 period. The number of anti-competitive practices eliminated was 17, exceeding the target by a large margin. As noted in the section on relevance of results indicator, the sole number does not tell if the business environment was enhanced. Therefore, the achievement of result is modest. 
Overall, results show satisfactory progress for the objective. 
Rating 
Satisfactory 
Overall Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy) 

Rationale 
Since efficacy for the three objectives is satisfactory, overall efficacy is also satisfactory. Under objective one (enhancing fiscal consolidation), tax revenue increased, the wage bill declined and there was some strengthening in debt management. Under objective two (ensuring sustainable energy supply) energy subsidies declined, energy governance improved and the transition to low carbon energy started successfully. Under objective three (enhancing the business environment) the investment regime became more transparent, the burden of industrial licensing fell, and the competitive framework was streamlined. The program did not have any significant shortcomings. 


Overall Efficacy Rating 
Satisfactory 
6. Outcome 


Rationale 
The program shows positive results in all the areas. Important achievements were the large reductions in the energy subsidies and the wage bill and the increase in tax revenue; the three results helped reduce the fiscal deficit to 7.8 percent of GDP and generate a primary surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in FY2019/20. Energy security improved substantially, because electricity consumption fell and its supply increased, driven by the expansion of renewable energy and gas production. The business environment improved, brought about by (a) simplifications in the investment regime and industrial licensing. The investment regime became more transparent, especially for small companies, and the reforms in licensing reduced the time and cost of getting a license. Anti-cartel policy and the competitive framework also were strengthened. 

a. Rating 
Satisfactory 
7. Risk to Development Outcome 
The reforms in electricity prices and wages prevented the government from falling into a fiscal abyss. Had they not been done, the difficult fiscal situation would have worsened. They were central elements of the program together with the tax reforms. The reforms are likely to be maintained and enhanced because the fiscal deficit and the debt service are still high: in 2019/20 the overall deficit for budget sector operations was 7.9 percent of GDP and interest payments to serve the debt were 9.8 percent of GDP (IMF Country Report No. 21/7, Table 3b). These numbers make it likely that the reforms will be maintained and hence their associated development outcomes. Therefore, on energy, wage bill, and tax reform the risk to development outcome is modest. 
During 2015-2019 Egypt moved from having chronic power shortages to having a 25 surplus in its supply of electricity, a result of lower consumption and 25.5 GW of new generating capacity, which included one GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) and about 840 MW of new wind capacity (see North Africa�s pathways to clean energy transitions � Analysis - IEA). Liberalizing the foreign currency regime and reforming laws, regulations, and institutions governing renewable energy contributed to this expansion. Renewable energy still represents a small portion of total power output, but between 2015 and 2019 its production increased by about 25 percent, triggered by the reforms. Because Egypt needs to rely more on gas and renewable energy, the reforms and outcomes achieved are likely to be maintained. Therefore, the  risk to development outcome is modest. 

While the above risks seem to be modest, the worsening domestic and external environments have raised the risk from the high public debt. Despite the advances of the past five years in fiscal policy and debt management, there is a substantial risk from a worsening economy triggering pressures to raise government expenditure and debt levels, weakening debt management and the fiscal discipline observed so far. This risk might offset the modest development outcome risks of the program, making the overall risk for outcomes substantial. 

8. Assessment of Bank Performance 
a. Bank Performance � Design 


Rationale 
The World Bank knew the problems and solutions in the sectors covered by the program, a result of its analytical work, lennding and technical assistance activities in Egypt. It helped the Bank that the government had laid the groundwork for the reforms two years earlier. The Bank assessed program risks well and selected appropriate mitigation measures to reduce those risks, such as enhancing the safety net for the lowest income groups, the potentially major losers from the reforms in the short-term. The cooperation with the IMF, which rovided a three-year Extended Fund Facility credit after the DPF1 loan, supported the program, as several policy actions in the IMF program complemented those of the Bank�s program. The Bank gathered a multi-sectoral team that conducted 13 preparation missions for the three operations, which reflected in its good design. 

Rating 
Satisfactory 
b. Bank Performance � Implementation 

Rationale 
The Bank knew well the risks of operating in Egypt. To mitigate them it offered technical assistance at the technical level and maintained a seamless policy dialogue with the authorities to manage the pollical barriers to implementing the program. Structuring the operations one year apart from each other ensured that the Bank could supervise each one constantly. Some of the team members preparing and supervising the program were based in Cairo; they kept in permanent contact with the authorities and contributed to the preparation of the Implementation and Status Results filed for DPF1 and DPF2. 
Rating 
Satisfactory 

c. Overall Bank Performance 

Rationale 
Since Bank performance was satisfactory in the design and supervision of the program, the overall rating for Bank performance is satisfactory. 

Overall Bank Performance Rating 
Satisfactory 
9. Other Impacts 
a. Social and Poverty 
The poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) presented in the program documents estimated the welfare loss for consumers from direct and indirect price changes of fuel and electricity. The analysis found that the welfare loss: (a) for the average household was 5.6 percent of consumption; (b) for the poorest and richest quintiles was 
7.3 percent and 4.4 percent of consumption; and (c) attributable to actions under DPF3 was higher than for actions under DPF2 (average loss of 4.2 percent) and for actions under DPF1 (average loss of 0.27 percent). The exercises also found that food subsidy and cash transfer payments were insufficient to offset the loss in real income from inflation. 
Information from the 2015 and 2018 Household Income and Consumption Surveys shows that the poverty headcount rose from 27.8 percent to 32.5 percent. The increase in poverty comes in part from the changes in fuel and electricity prices, but other reforms and overall economic performance also contributed to the rise. 
The welfare loss estimated constitutes an upper bound impact of the reforms. The estimates exclude welfare gains from the absence of power outages such as time saving in house chores and other gains in quality of life. The estimated loss should be contrasted with the potential loss in consumer welfare if the reforms had not been carried out, the fiscal situation had deteriorated further and growth had been slower than what it was. 

b. Environmental 
The environmental impact is likely to have been positive. Higher electricity prices reduced the demand for fuel and stimulated a larger supply of energy from renewable resources, thereby reducing pollution. 

c. Gender 
The ICR notes that the unemployment rate fell from 13.2 to 9.9 percent between FY13�FY18, in part because a fall in labor force participation. The ICR does not report effects by gender. 

The labor force participation rate fell from 47.9 to 46.5 percent between 2015 and 2020 (Egypt Labor force participation - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com). For men the rate fell from 72.5 to less than 71 percent (Egypt Male labor force participation - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com) and for women it fell from 22.5 to 
22.1 percent (Egypt Female labor force participation - data, chart | TheGlobalEconomy.com). The numbers indicate that men participation fell more than women, part of it possibly attributable to the program�s reforms. 



d. Other 
The ICR notes that the quality of institutions and regulations improved in some agencies and regulatory areas. 
10. Quality of ICR 


Rationale 
The ICR analyzes the program well, presents good and appropriate evidence to support its conclusions, focuses on the results of the program and integrates well and in a consistent manner its different sections. In the lessons section the ICR could have summarized in short bullet points the main (one, two or three) lessons under each subheading of the section.

12. Lessons 
The ICR offers the following finding and lessons with which the review agrees: 
. 
The most important reason for the success of the DPF series was the Government�s ownership of the reform program, which had been started before the DPF program. 

. 
Leadership in monitoring and coordinating the program by one government agency, in this case the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation, was fundamental to resolve blockages throughout the program. 

. 
A complex program with potentially large redistributive effects requires a communication strategy to explain the reform program to the public. Such effort involves reaching a wide group of people (NGO, citizen groups, legislators) to explain the reforms and their objectives and build support for them. Doing so helps raise awareness about the distributional impact of maintaining the status quo, where the main beneficiaries of the energy subsidies were the richest groups. 

. 
In the short run it is difficult to offset the full impact of an adjustment action like a large devaluation. The welfare effects of such actions and their impact on the poor are likely to be offset over a longer period, in part by higher economic growth and job creation, and in part by targeted social protection measures. 

. 
Reforms seeking to correct misalignment in the structure of prices of electricity and energy products must be accompanied by tax measures and the reduction of electricity and fuel subsidies with the creation of fiscal space to finance social protection programs to help the poorest groups. 

. 
A good stock of knowledge can enhance the substance and the quality of design and implementation of a reform program aimed at bringing deep structural changes in the power sector. That knowledge and background permitted the Bank to make a good case for the relevant actions, their impact on critical groups of society and their link to the program�s stated objectives. 

. 
Early and sustained collaboration within the World Bank Group and a staffing model based on field-based task team leaders facilitated the exchange of information within the Group and helped build a strong relationship with the client and keep program implementation on track.
