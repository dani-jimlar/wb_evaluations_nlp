2. Program Objectives and Pillars/Policy Areas
EVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives

The original program development objectives (PDOs) of the Solomon Islands Transition to Sustainable Growth
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series (as stated in the ICR, para. 6) and the program document (PD1) for
the first operation in 2020 were:

    i. Strengthening fiscal management in the areas of debt management, cash management and budget
       management;
    ii. Strengthening the business environment through simplifying tax processes, fighting corruption and
       supporting more efficient payments systems.

In 2021, the second DPO modified the PDOs as follows:

     i. “budget management” was changed to “procurement” in PDO1;
    ii. added a third objective: “Improve environmental sustainability by strengthening national planning for
       climate change and reducing plastic pollution”.

For the purpose of this ICR Review, the PDOs are taken as follows:

      PDO1: Strengthen fiscal management;
      PDO2: Strengthen the business environment;


                                                                                                    Page 2 of 22

      PDO3: Improve environmental sustainability.


b. Pillars/Policy Areas
The Pillars as stated in the PDs were identical to the PDOs. For the purpose of this ICR Review, the Pillars and
Policy Areas (as indicated PD1 and PD2, section 4.2) are represented as follows:

      Pillar 1: Strengthen fiscal management:
             o Debt/budget management
             o Cash management
             o Procurement
      Pillar 2: Strengthen the business environment:
             o Tax administration
             o Anti-corruption
             o Payments systems
      Pillar 3: Improve environmental sustainability
             o Strengthen national planning for climate change
             o Reduce plastic pollution


c. Comments on Program Cost, Financing and Dates

Financing: Total financing of US$45 million was provided as follows:

     i. DPO1: IDA credit for US$3.16 million and (IDA grant of US$11.84 million
    ii. DPO2: IDA grant of US$15 million and a Supplementary IDA grant of US$15 million.

Dates:

      DPO1 was approved on 6 May 2020, and became effective on 29 May 2020.
      DPO2 was approved on 30 November 2021, and became effective on 14 December 2021.

Actual disbursements totaled US$44,596,055 (US$ 15,330,543 in DPO1, US$ 29,265,512 in DPO2), due to
variations in the exchange rate.

The operations closed as expected on 30 November, 2021, and 31 March, 2023, respectively.


3. Relevance of Design

a. Relevance of Objectives

 Country Context

 The Solomon Islands (SI) faces the development challenges of fragility, conflict and vulnerability (FCV). Its
 economic growth prospects are constrained by the wide dispersion of its small (but rapidly-growing)

                                                                                                     Page 3 of 22

population of nearly 750,000 people spread over some 900 geographically remote islands and by its heavy
dependence on exports of “grossly unsustainable log production” (PD1, paras. 3-4). Civil conflict from 1998 to
2003 (“the Tensions”) resulted in a 40 percent drop in GDP and remains a potential concern (with smaller
riots in 2006 and 2019 and major ones in 2021). It is vulnerable to major earthquakes and tsunamis, which
caused substantial destruction in 2007 and 2013, and “the 2014 Honiara floods caused widespread damage,
loss of life and economic disruption,” as well as closure of its only gold mine (PD1, paras. 3 and 89). These
fragilities mean that “on average, Solomon Islanders are relatively worse off today than they were over 20
years ago,” with a GDP per capita under US$ 600 (PD1, para. 3). Although the Solomon Islands government
(SIG) managed to insulate the country from COVID-19 in 2020-21, lockdowns following an outbreak in
December 2021 aggravated the negative economic effects and compromised the functioning of government,
including tax collection (ICR, para. 8).

The DPO series was part of a coordinated budget support mechanism (including Australia, New Zealand, the
Asian Development Bank, and the European Union) to address the additional financing needs to cope with
the COVID-19 pandemic and the longer-term objectives of fiscal consolidation, improving the business
environment (to reduce dependence on logging), and supporting policy dialogue and provision of technical
assistance (TA) (PD1, para. 1). Addressing gender inequality and the Solomon Islands’ low Human Capital
Index were other areas of concern (PD1, para. 6-7).

Relevance of Objectives

PDO1 was clearly relevant to addressing the fiscal issues faced by the SIG as a result of COVID-19 and
other recent shocks, as well as fundamental weaknesses in the fiscal systems. PDO2 was relevant to
improving administrative constraints on private investors’ ability to contribute to economic growth, and its tax
reform actions also supported fiscal objectives.

The coherence of adding PDO3 to this series was less clear. This DPO series was oriented toward budget
support for recovery from the “triple shocks” of COVID-19, civil unrest and rising global prices (ICR, para. 2)
and explicitly intended to focus on fiscal management and the business environment (tax, corruption, and
payment systems aspects; PD1, para. 2). Neither PD2 (para 34) nor the ICR (para. 10) provided a convincing
explanation of how introducing initial actions toward supporting “the green growth” agenda related to the
focus of this DPO series. Ensuring environmental sustainability was a general portfolio concern for the World
Bank (WB), limited institutional capacity and prioritization of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic forestalled
preparation at the time of a separate series of operations to address the environmental agenda. In 2023, the
Solomon Islands Resilience series of two DPOs was prepared to focus on resilience to climate change,
disasters and health emergencies, including follow-up on the actions that were initiated by adding PDO3 to
the series under review.

The PDOs supported the second focus area of the WB Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY2018-24 for
“strengthening the foundations of well-being,” as well as the IDA19 pillars on “promoting sustainable financial
practices” and “building confidence in institutions” (ICR, para. 5). They were also aligned with the pillars of the
WB’s COVID-19 response strategy regarding strengthening policies and institutions and ensuring sustainable
business growth. WB involvement was warranted to help address the increasingly severe fiscal constraints
from multiple shocks and the technical assistance needed to implement many reforms.

PDO1 and PDO2 were consistent with the objectives of SIG’s National Development Strategy (NDS)
regarding public financial management (PFM) reforms and inclusive economic growth (PD1, paras. 32-33).

PDO3 was added in response to the updated NDS’s “blueprint for SIG’s climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions over the medium term” (PD2, para. 34).


b. Relevance of Prior Actions

Rationale

The series had 12 PAs (5 in DPO1, 7 in DPO2) with a total of 14 distinct actions/sub-actions. The ICR (Figure
1) provided a Theory of Change showing the relationship of the PAs to seven expected outcomes and their
relevance to the PDOs. Four of the DPO1 PAs had follow-up actions in DPO2, which also introduced actions
in three new policy areas.

PDO1: Strengthen fiscal management:

PA1 and PA2 were highly relevant to the fiscal management objective by strengthening compliance with debt
management guidelines and publishing new debt management regulations. They addressed weaknesses
identified in the 2012 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability and the 2014 SIG PFM Roadmap
(PD1, Table 4). PA1 rectified the problem that, despite progress in strengthening debt management, the
absence of a “legislative provision for adherence to the respective policies render[ed] the broader debt
management framework vulnerable to undue political influence” (PD1, para. 38). PA2 addressed the low
rating by the 2020 World Bank Debt Management Performance Assessment due to an out-of-date strategy by
updating (with technical assistance from the WB and IMF) and publishing the strategy (PD2, para. 39). With
upcoming infrastructure projects putting pressure on borrowing, these measures were important to minimize
the negative potential impact of increasing debt (especially foreign) on both fiscal and exchange rate stability
(ICR, para. 15). They also were relevant to revitalizing implementation of the 2014 PFM Reform Roadmap
and the 2005 Honiara Club Agreement with external creditors to reduce debt servicing pressures (PD1,
paras. 36-37). Relevance ratings: PA1: Highly Satisfactory (HS); PA2: Highly Satisfactory (HS).

PA3 responded to the 2017 crisis when SIG depleted its cash reserves and entered into significant
expenditure arrears due to “poor fiscal discipline, weak cash management and inadequate expenditure and
commitment controls” (PD1, para. 42). PA 3 implemented the recommendation of the 2018 report by the
Pacific Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) report, Strengthening the Fundamentals of Public Financial
Management, to establish a Cash Management Committee that “meets monthly to monitor cash balances
and upcoming commitments, prioritize discretionary payments where necessary, and to provide advice to
management on cashflow‐related risks” (PD1, paras. 43-44). However, follow-through actions to issue
regulations for enhanced oversight of ministerial expenditures were suspended when “capacity constraints in
MoFT, triggered by the COVID-19 crisis” led to suspension of the indicative trigger (IT) in favor of a

procurement-related action in DPO2 (ICR, para. 16). PD2 does not discuss cash management or what
subsequent steps might replace the dropped IT. Relevance rating: PA3: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PA4 addressed the absence of “regulations setting out the details of the budget formulation process and
procedures for in‐year adjustments to appropriations” and of rules for medium-term fiscal planning,
sometimes leading to last-minute political adjustments to allocations (PD1, para. 37). PA4 implemented
recommendations of the 2014 PFM Reform Roadmap and 2018 PFTAC report by introducing binding rules to
address the persistent procurement “inefficiencies and integrity issues due to: the lack of a sufficient
regulatory framework; lack of supporting documents and templates; lack of a central procurement policy unit;
lack of access to information; and the lack of an independent complaints mechanism,” as identified in a 2012
WB Operational Procurement Review (PD2, para. 43). This was highly relevant to the fiscal management
objective by improving transparency and efficiency in procurement, including the costs of excessive single-
source contracts and overpricing (PD2, para. 42). Relevance rating: PA4: Highly Satisfactory (HS).

PDO2: Strengthen the business environment:

PA5 was a relevant first step toward improving tax administration for a better business environment by
reducing “cumbersome processes for taxpayers,” leveling the playing field, and thereby “strengthening trust in
the state” (ICR, para. 18). The Tax Administration Act redressed fragmented and cumbersome processes by
providing “a common set of rules, offenses and penalties across all tax types…, simplify[ing] taxpayer
obligations and remove[ing] scope for administrative discretion” (PD2, para. 49). It implemented
recommendations of “both the 2014 PFM Reform Roadmap and PFTAC’s more recent (2018) PFM
assessment” (PD1, para. 48). However, the planned next step of issuing regulations was delayed “due to the
administrative bottlenecks created by the COVID-19 crisis,” and DPO2 replaced the corresponding IT and PA
with a focus on the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO; see PA6), though it did not mention whether or how
issuance of regulations might be resumed (ICR, para. 18). Relevance rating: PA5: Satisfactory (S).

PA6 to establish a LTO was relevant to reducing non-compliance by large taxpayers, who provided a major
proportion of revenues (PD2, para. 51), and hence to PDO1. It was part of a “wider initiative to restructure to
modernize the IRD [Inland Revenue Division] and ensure it is equipped to effectively implement SIG’s tax
reform agenda” (PD2, para. 52). It was relevant to PDO2 insofar as “greater specialization of IRD staff
[would] streamline interactions with taxpayers.” Relevance rating: PA6: Satisfactory (S).

PA7 and PA8 were critical to addressing the pervasive problems of corruption identified in the 2015 WB
business enterprise survey as a major constraint by 65 percent of firms, with bribery also affecting public
access to services (PD1, para. 56). PA7 was a necessary first step toward compliance with the United
Nations Convention Against Corruption of passing the Anti-corruption Act in 2018 to create the Solomon
Islands Independent Commission Against Corruption (SIICAC), with Commissioners sworn in as of
December 2019, as DPO1 was being prepared (PD2, paras. 58-60). The SIICAC had the authority to receive
complaints about potential corruption, investigate and prosecute corruption cases. Achievement of the
objective depended on the implementation measures appropriately supported by PA8. Relevance ratings:
PA7: Highly Satisfactory (HS); PA8: Highly Satisfactory (HS).

PA9 and PA10 supported implementation of the WBG Pacific Payments, Remittances and Securities
Settlement Initiative (PAPRI) concerning the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for payments
systems and modern electronic payments (PD1, para. 64). The manual payments system was highly
inefficient and a constraint on growth of an economy spread across many islands with a largely unbanked
population (ICR, para. 20). Due to parliamentary delays stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, DPO2 pivoted

 from the original IT relating to issuance of regulations to focus on implementing the Automated Fund Transfer
 System (ATS) for government payments and receipts, which was relevant to the objective of improving the
 environment for private business and anyone interacting with the government (PD2, paras. 65-67).
 Relevance ratings: PA9: Highly Satisfactory (HS); PA10: Highly Satisfactory (HS).

 PDO3: Improve environmental sustainability

 PA11 to strengthen the ambition of Solomon Islands’ climate change mitigation and adaption goals was
 intended to implement commitments under various international climate change protocols and SIG’s 2012-
 2017 Climate Change Policy (PD2, para. 69). Climate change and attendant extreme weather events clearly
 threatened economic development, as noted in the Solomon Islands National Adaptation Program of Action.
 Nonetheless, given the Solomon Islands’ negligible contribution to global carbon emissions, the rationale for
 focusing on net zero emissions by 2050 is unclear, given that achieving climate neutrality would divert
 significant financing into hydropower and solar investments (ICR, para. 21), away from other infrastructure
 needs. Measures to promote adaptation through community-level assessments and revision of environmental
 laws made more sense, but were not specified in the PA (though the results indicator [RI 8] captured
 assessments). PD1 (para. 71) noted that women may be disproportionately vulnerable to negative climate
 change effects, but the PA did not specify any relevant actions (although the RI did). Relevance rating:
 PA11: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

 PA12 was intended to stem the impact on waterways of improper disposal of plastic products by taxing
 single-use plastic products and those with toxic components. While this measure would promote compliance
 with the policies of Pacific Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter 2018-2025 and the Stockholm Convention
 on organic pollutants, in the absence of analytical work on the likely impact of taxing plastic waste, the results
 chain to improved medium-term environmental sustainability was less clear (PD2, para. 75). While PD2
 (para. 74) explained that growing use of plastics was polluting the environment, it did not clearly explain the
 importance of plastic pollution relative to other threats to environmental sustainability, nor how restraining
 future imports would substantially “improve environmental sustainability” (as distinct from mitigating
 deterioration), nor whether more environment-friendly and impactful alternatives were available. The PD did
 not discuss how productive sectors were being impacted by plastic pollution nor measures to ensure the
 availability of substitutes for the affected plastic products. Nevertheless, plastic pollution was incurring both
 economic and fiscal damage through adverse effects on fish populations and fishing gear, providing breeding
 grounds for disease-bearing mosquitos, and public expenditures on clean-up (especially beaches) to
 minimize adverse impact on tourism. The expected increase in revenues would also contribute to PDO1
 (PD2, para. 76). Relevance rating: PA12: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

PDO1: Strengthen fiscal management

RI1 was highly relevant to both implementation of the associated PAs and achievement of the objective, usefully
providing a distinct sub-indicator for each aspect. RI1(i) monitored compliance with the Annual Borrowing Limit,
while RI1(ii) tracked shifting the composition of debt from foreign to domestic. Both were reasonably attributable
to implementation of the actions and readily measurable. Relevance ratings: RI1(i): Highly Satisfactory; RI1(ii):
Highly Satisfactory (HS).

RI2 regarding expenditure arrears was satisfactory to represent implementation of PA3, although attribution was
difficult because actions other than monitoring by the Cash Management Committee also affected arrears (ICR,
para. 26). It was at best moderately related to achievement of the broader cash management objectives (an IT
and sub-indicator for meeting IMF recommendations were dropped in DPO2). The indicator was readily
measurable and available. Relevance rating: RI2: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI3 was highly relevant both to implementation of the regulations supported by PA4 and the key objectives of
increasing transparency [RI 3(i) on publishing contracts online] and competition/efficiency [RI 3(ii) on bid
waivers]. PD2 (paras. 42-47) clearly explained the rationale and how the indicators would capture the expected
results. Relevance ratings: RI3(i): Highly Satisfactory (HS); RI3(ii): Highly Satisfactory (HS).

PDO 2: Strengthen the business environment

RI4 focused on the results from implementation of PA6 (enabled by PA5) on large taxpayers, who represent
large businesses as well as a major source of tax revenue. It tracked the impact of improved tax administration
in terms of on-line [RI 4(i)] and on-time [RI 4(ii)] filing by large taxpayers, as well as reduction in their outstanding
debt [RI 4(iii)] – all relevant to the objective of improving the business environment by easing the administrative
burden of tax compliance. Although the RI did not capture other aspects of the objective of simplified tax
administration, nor the complementary objective of enhanced revenues (PDO1), PD2 (para. 51) explained the

                                                                                                         Page 12 of 22

rationale for focusing on the LTO. Relevance ratings: RI4(i): Satisfactory (S); RI4(ii): Satisfactory (S); RI4(iii):
Satisfactory (S).

RI5 was a simple, reasonable indicator of the functioning of the SIICAC in terms of its reporting to Parliament,
which was the key instrument for progress toward the objective of reducing corruption. While it did not track the
actual objective of reduced corruption, it was appropriate to indicate whether a necessary first step was being
taken toward activating the independent agency and making information transparently available. Relevance
rating: RI5: Satisfactory (S).

Although RI6 on female SIICAC Commissioners was not related to any specific actions under DPO1 or DPO2.
PD2 (para. 57) made the case that women tend to be more vulnerable to corruption in trying to access
government contracts and services, and that this may “hinder women in the informal sector from entering the
formal sector,” thus adversely affecting the business environment with respect to participation of women.
Monitoring the inclusion of women as SIICAC Commissioners was a reasonable, if modest, indicator that the
SIICAC would be less likely to ignore the interests of women. Although the direct impact would depend on the
functioning of the SIICAC, the appointment of women commissioners would indicate that the gender dimensions
of corruption were being recognized. Relevance rating: RI6: Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI7 was directly relevant to implementation of PAs 9 and 10 to authorize and institute electronic automation of
government payments. PD2 (para. 66) made the case that these improvements in the interbank clearing system
would “promote the ease of doing business and allow for the safe introduction of innovative digital payments
instruments that have the potential to increase financial inclusion.” Hence RI7(i) on use of electronic payments
was also relevant to the PDO2 objective of strengthening the business environment. RI7(ii) on bank transaction
fees was more relevant to PDO1, since it concerned only government budgetary costs. Relevance ratings: RI
7(i): Highly Satisfactory (HS); RI7(ii): Satisfactory (S).

PDO 3: Improve environmental sustainability

RI8 regarding community assessments related to the objective of strengthening national planning for climate
change to support PDO3 with respect to one aspect of climate change adaptation under the updated Nationally
Determined Contribution (NDC) supported by PA11 (PD2, para. 72). Although RI 8(i) did not address the
emissions goals under the NDC, it focused on the more immediately relevant need for community-based
vulnerability assessments to improve awareness and adaptation at the local level. The PD did not explain,
however, how these assessments and planning would lead to the outcome of improved environmental
sustainability. RI 8(ii) added a gender dimension to the indicator, motivated by evidence that SI women were
more vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change and that analysis of gender-specific roles and power
dynamics is needed (PD2, para. 71). However, this represented only an input to the process, and the
relationship of the indicator to the PA is at best indirect (the updated NDS “introduced a focus on gender”).
Nonetheless, PD2 (para. 73) argued that incorporation of gender analysis would indicate progress in national
planning for climate change by "taking into account women's distinct vulnerabilities and their key role in climate
change action". Relevance ratings: RI8(i): Satisfactory (S); RI8(ii): Moderately Satisfactory (MS).

RI9 related to implementation of PA12 but could not be fully attributed to it because the effect of a tax on
demand for (and hence subsequent importation of) plastic bags cannot readily be distinguished from the
negative impact on demand of COVID-19-related lockdowns and economic decline. While the PD2 (para. 74)
explained that growing use of plastics was polluting the environment, it did not convincingly explain how relevant
monitoring the rate of increase in imported plastics was to progress in achieving the objective of environmental
sustainability. Imports of single-use plastics was considered a direct proxy for annual consumption and that

               Rationale
               RI1(i): Although total borrowing of SBD470 million in 2021 exceeded the debt limit of SBD350 at the time
               (raised in 2022 to SBD850 million), the ICR (para. 24) considered that the integrity of the Debt Management
               Framework was achieved in the sense of compliance with the Annual Borrowing Limit (ABL) on average over
               2019-22, with average borrowing of SBD331 million remaining below the average ABL for the period of
               SBD450 million. Borrowing in 2023 of SBD588 million remained under the ABL of SBD865 million – raised
               again to allow for increased spending and borrowing for the 2023 Pacific Games and preparation for general
               elections. Government was able to absorb spending for these two events of just over 4 percent of GDP
               without adverse consequences for cash balances. The result was consistent with the objective of
               strengthened debt management under the assumption that adjustments to the ABD were consistent with debt
               sustainability. Achievement Rating: RI 1(i): High.

               RI1(ii) indicated that the desired shift from heavy reliance on foreign borrowing toward a greater share of
               domestic debt was more than fully achieved (through a cumulative addition to domestic debt of SBD7.3
               million over 2021-23 compared to an additional SBD3.3 million of foreign borrowing; ICR, Table 2). While the
               overall fiscal and debt situation was worsening (ICR, para. 24), in part due to a surge in borrowing in 2022 to
               cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions to strengthen management of situation were being
               implemented and achieving the desired result with respect to the composition of debt. Achievement Rating:
               RI1(i): High.

               RI2 indicated that the actions under PA3 to improve cash management were having the intended effect on
               large taxpayers, with a decline in their tax arrears of triple the targeted decrease, consistent with the objective
               of strengthened fiscal management. Due to MS rating for RI2, achievement is rated as Substantial.
               Achievement Rating: RI2: Substantial.

               RI3(i) indicated that issuance of the PFM (Procurement) Regulations under PA4 had been fully effective in
               increasing transparency through publishing on-line all contracts made by the Central Tender Board in 2023,
               including the amount and name of the tenderer (ICR, para. 28). Achievement Rating: RI3(i): High.

RI3(ii) monitored whether the granting of procurement bid waivers had returned to the level prior to the surge
in special waivers in 2020 related to the COVID-19 response. Although the number of waivers in 2023 had
declined from the peak of 354 in 2020 (ICR, para. 28), it remained 74 percent above the pre-COVID level.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Strengthen the business environment

Rationale
RI4 tracked the implementation and impact of enabling electronic filing of taxes under PA5 and
operationalizing the Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) under PA6 in three ways. RI4(i) indicated the extent of
increase in on-line filing as a result of streamlining operations, with a major increase from 10 to 73 percent,
over four times the targeted increase. (The ICR, para. 30, also reported an increase in online registrations of
double what was expected, but this was not an explicit part of the RI as stated.) Nevertheless, this did not
result in any increase in the on-time filing rate, yielding negligible achievement of RI4(ii). RI4(iii) represented
the outcome of measures by the LTO to enhance interactions with large taxpayers (despite some COVID-19
related delays) in the form of a decrease in their outstanding tax debt, which exceeded the targeted 25
percent reduction (i.e., below SBD 102 million, although PD2 and the ICR put it at SBD 125 million).
Achievement Ratings: RI4(i): High; RI4(ii): Negligible; RI4(iii): High.

RI5 measured progress in implementing PAs 7-8 to establish and operationalize the SIICAC in terms of its
issuing Annual Reports to Parliament and on-line, toward the objective of greater transparency to improve the
business environment. Failure to achieve the target signaled that SIICAC was “struggling to become
operational” and develop an organizational strategy, let alone address the limitations on its powers and
accountability (ICR, para. 33). Achievement Rating: RI5: Negligible.

RI6 represented an attempt to monitor the extent to which gender issues relating to corruption were likely to
be considered by the SIICAC, in terms of at least 40 percent of its commissioners being women, which was
achieved. While this represented a positive step toward the gender objective of greater participation of
women in decision-making, the negligible progress in operationalizing the SIICAC compromised the impact to
date on the objective of reducing corruption. Achievement Rating: RI6: Substantial.

RI7 was intended to track implementation of measures under PAs 9 and 10 to improve the efficiency of
payments systems in terms of the utilization of e-payments by commercial banks [ RI7(i)] and the outcome
(relevant to PDO1) in terms of reduced bank transaction fees [RI7(ii) ]. Neither was achieved as of the initial
target date, because the disruptions of COVID-19 and riots in 2022 forestalled implementation of the ATS
(ICR, para. 36). The payment system finally became operational in March 2024, and 2024 data on RI7(i)

                  Rationale
                  RI8(i) tracked implementation of steps toward the objective of strengthening national planning for climate
                  change in the form of Integrated Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments conducted at the community level.
                  Progress was made in two (as against the target of three) provinces but hindered by restrictions on travel due
                  to government cash flow problems and COVID-19. Achievement Rating: RI8(i): Substantial.

                  RI8(ii) complemented RI 8(i) by adding a gender dimension to monitor the inclusion of women and gender
                  considerations in the planning process. It was fully achieved in that focus/social groups and discussions
                  included women and gender considerations, which were relevant to PDO3 in view of the relatively high
                  vulnerability of women to the effects of climate and the importance of an inclusive approach to
                  planning. Achievement Rating: RI8(ii): Substantial.

                  RI9 monitored whether annual imports of polyethylene plastic bags were falling, as a step toward mitigating
                  plastic pollution in order to enhance environmental sustainability. While imports in 2022 did fall below the
                  2020 level, this only partially offset the increase in 2021, and in any case could not clearly be attributable to
                  the environmental levy under PA12 as distinguished from the impact on demand of COVID-related lockdowns
                  and economic decline. Achievement Rating: RI 9: Substantial.

7. Risk to Development Outcome

Fiscal and macroeconomic risks remain the paramount threat to sustaining progress. Declining government
cash balances were vulnerable to continued pressure from the costs of holding the Pacific Games in November-
December 2023 and a national election in 2024. Government was able to absorb spending for these two events
of just over 4 percent of GDP without adverse consequences for cash balances. GDP growth and government
finances remain vulnerable to international commodity prices, particularly for logs (which in turn are not a
sustainable basis for continued growth). Fiscal space is lacking to cope with additional shocks, such as social
unrest (which remains a risk in an election year; ICR, para. 49). Mitigation depends heavily on continued access
to international financing.

Limited institutional capacity constrains implementation of reforms and poses a governance risk.
Operationalization of SIICAC and the LTO has proven cumbersome. Improvements in tax administration,
procurement, and other reforms likewise has been constrained by “thin administrative capacity” (ICR, para. 50).
SIG is mitigating these risks through selective focus on priority reforms, with technical support from the WBG
and other development partners and a new Solomon Islands Resilience DPO.

Fiduciary risks remain high due to “weak financial management, lack of internal controls, and inadequate
systems for financial reporting and auditing” (ICR, para. 51). Procurement processes remain particularly fraught,
and there are concerns about potential mismanagement of infrastructure projects (ICR, para. 49). The new
Public Procurement Regulations are intended to mitigate risks, but implementation is slow.

8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Bank Performance – Design

Rationale

Analytical underpinnings and lessons from prior experience

The design of the operations and specific actions drew directly on a range of reports, reviews and project
experience from multiple sources. Fiscal management and procurement priorities and actions were based on the
2012 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment, the 2014 SIG PFM Roadmap, the 2018
PFTAC report, the 2020 WB Debt Management Performance Assessment, and the 2012 World Bank
Operational Procurement Review (PD1, Table 4; PD2 Annex 5). Tax reforms drew on the 2014 Sapere review of
tax reform in the Pacific and the 2015 SI Inland Revenue Division Constraints Analysis; anti-corruption
measures on the 2014 and 2018 United Nations Conference against Corruption reviews; and payments systems
actions on PAPRI project papers. An Ecosystem and Socio-Economic Resilience Analysis and Mapping for both
Solomon Islands and Honiara by the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)
informed revision of SI’s NDC to Climate Change, and SPREP’s Pacific Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter
underpinned the action on plastic products.

SIG’s struggle to implement standards under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative provided a lesson
that capacity constraints might constraint implementation of overly ambitious reforms (PD2, para. 36). The DPO
series mitigated this by “focusing on a small number of reforms which have strong government ownership and
where development partner support is available for implementation.” Similar lessons from other Pacific Islands’
efforts to introduce e-tax and payments system reforms helped to inform the design of actions and targets for SI
(PD2, para. 37).

Results chain and indicators

The ICR (Figure 1) provided a basic results chain summarizing the relationship of the PAs to the RIs (outputs),
expected outcomes and PDOs. The PDs fully explained the context and rationale for the PAs and associated
RIs, and in some cases (especially in PD2) set out needed and planned further actions for implementation.

The RIs were generally satisfactory in tracking implementation of the PAs and achievement of objectives, in
several cases usefully providing separate sub-indicators relating to each aspect. Two RIs included suitable
gender implications, although not related to a specific action or stated objective. The Negligible achievement of
targets for five specific indicators/sub-indicators suggests some disconnect with respect to design and targeting,
although the ICR (para. 46) made the case that “certain delays in implementation would have been difficult to
anticipate.”

Identification and mitigation of risks

PD1 clearly identified substantial risks in the areas of politics and governance (including corruption and vested
interests), macroeconomic shocks, sector strategies (especially tax and corruption reforms), technical (payments
systems), institutional capacity, fiduciary, and environment/social (including impact of COVID-19). The
discussion in PD2, paras. 98-101, was abbreviated, but it highlighted the difficulties in mitigating institutional

capacity risks. Discussion of mitigation measures generally focused on provision of financing and technical
assistance (from other operations and development partners).

Consultation with stakeholders and development partners

The PAs drew on the Core Economic Working Group (CEWG) led by SIG with participation by the WB,
European Union, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Australia and New Zealand (PD2, para. 31). Although the
ICR and PDs did not provide specific evidence of consultations with other domestic stakeholders during the
design process, the ICR (para. 46) noted that the 2022 WB Public Expenditure Review played “a leading role in
the policy dialogue in public expenditure and debt management.” PD2 (para. 82) stated that SIG had carried out
regular public consultations regarding the Tax Administration Bill, and that the steering committee for the
National Anti-Corruption Strategy included civil society and the private sector, while “nationwide consultations”
were held on the payments systems bill (with support from the WB). PD1 (para. 90) considered stakeholder risks
as moderate (while nonetheless noting substantial risks of social unrest and pushback from vested interests). It
viewed development partners as the key stakeholders apart from the government itself.

Collaboration with development partners was substantial at all stages and for most policy areas. Key regional
collaborators included PFTAC and SPREP. The team coordinated closely with the IMF, ADB and the Australian
Government in preparing specific components and providing technical assistance, with additional TA from
UNDP, New Zealand and the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PD2, paras. 58, 81 and 91).



Rating

Highly Satisfactory

b. Bank Performance – Implementation

Rationale

Monitoring

Border closures to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent restrictions to control it both necessitated and
constrained close monitoring of progress. The team remained in contact with Government counterparts to
maintain monitoring during this period. RIs were readily measured and monitorable. The ICR (para. 53) noted
that monitoring could have been improved through more active use of the Joint Policy Reform Group (JPRG).

Adaptation

Substantial adaptations were made in response to events during implementation. The WB Team responded to
the 2021 riots by mobilizing supplemental grant financing of US$15 million even after approval of DPO2 to help
mitigate the fiscal impact of COVID-19 restrictions as well as the civil unrest, in order to maintain the flow of
funds, reduce the risk of further social unrest, and minimize expenditure arrears (ICR, para. 12). Priorities shifted
from budget management to procurement regulations in DPO2, which were regarded as “more achievable” (ICR,
para. 10). PDO3 was added in response to “the growing importance of the green agenda,” as put forth in an
updated NDS (ICR, para. 10).

Rationale

The ICR provided a coherent, clearly-written narrative of the context, rationale, objectives, actions and results of
the SI DPO series. It thoroughly documented successes and setbacks in implementation, including useful data
(and footnotes), and it analyzed relevant gaps, challenges, and risks. Lessons learned were thoughtful and
rooted in the experience of the DPOs. It was consistent with the guidelines.

12. Lessons

A comprehensive support package is needed for budget support to FCV states to be effective. Analytical
work, policy dialogue, TA and capacity-building are important complements to transfer of funds when institutional
capacity is limited (ICR, para. 52). Collaboration with other development partners is particularly important to
develop a suitable, comprehensive program of support.

Donor coordination is important for monitoring as well as design and implementation. COVID-19
restrictions constrained monitoring in the field. The ICR (para. 53) observed that more active use of the JPRG
could have enhanced review of progress and dialogue with the Government to ensure achievement of
objectives.

Focus on a limited number of achievable actions is important for success in an FCV context. Limited
institutional capacity makes it difficult to implement a wide range of actions, even with TA. Even with a limited
number of action areas in DPO1, delays in some areas (due in part to the impact of COVID-19 and civil conflict)
required adjustments in what actions could be carried through to DPO2.

Deep and ongoing political economy analysis is needed to support difficult reforms, such as anti-
corruption and climate change planning. Reforms in these areas represented only initial steps toward
addressing the difficult gender dimensions, requiring further analysis regarding progress, challenges and further
measures that are needed. TA cannot readily address the vested interests and cultural aspects of such areas,
