2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   According to the Project Appraisal Document (PD), the program development objective (PDO) for the Chad
   Digitalization of Revenue Administrations and COVID-19 Response Project (PROMOGRI) was "to improve
   performance, processes, and transparency in key government entities for revenue mobilization." (PD, p. 13).
   The PDO was not stated in the Financing Agreement.

   For this ICRR, the PDO is unpacked into three PDOs to be assessed separately:


                                                                                                 Page 1 of 35

d. Components
   The project consisted of three components:

   Component A: Results-based Financing to Support Change Management in Customs and Tax
   Administrations (Approved US$12 million, Revised Allocation (1) US$19 million, Revised Allocation (2)
   US$ 21.5 million; Actual US$21.5 million): This component aimed to enhance digitalization in Chad's tax
   and customs administrations using Results-based Financing. The goal was to create incentives for the
   Directorate General of Tax (DGI), Directorate General of Customs and Indirect Taxation (DGDDI), and the
   Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoFB) to drive meaningful change in the tax system, benefiting both
   consumers/citizens and the government. Component A consisted of two sub-components:

          Subcomponent A.1 focused on advancing key reforms in tax administration. It aimed to streamline
           processes and enhance compliance through initiatives such as the establishment of a unified
           taxpayers' registry for enterprises, promoting electronic filing among large taxpayers, facilitating
           mandatory tax payments via the banking system for large taxpayers, and encouraging the adoption
           of pay-by-phone methods for small tax taxpayers.
          Subcomponent A.2: focused on reducing physical customs inspections-Performance-Based
           Condition (PBC) 5 and expediting the release time for imported goods (PBC 6).

   These efforts were pivotal in steering the comprehensive digitalization of Chad's revenue administrations,
   which aimed to improve efficiency and reducing human interaction in line with broader economic
   infrastructure strengthening initiatives.

   Component A was affected by both the first (Restructuring No. 1) and second (Restructuring No. 2)
   restructurings:

          Restructuring No.1 reallocated US$7 million from Component B to Component A. The financing
           allocations for Component 3 remained unchanged at US$1.75 million.


                                                                                                   Page 2 of 35
  Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)                             Implementation Completion Report (ICR) Review
  Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)



      Restructuring No.2, on the other hand, focused on addressing performance challenges within
       Component A. At that point, 75% of the allocated amount (US$15.66 million) had been disbursed.
       However, two out of six PBCs under Component 1, namely PBC 1 and PBC 3, intended to facilitate
       communication on the impact of COVID-19 fiscal measures and expedite tax return processing
       during the pandemic, faced disbursement issues due to inefficient coordination among key entities.
       Additionally, two other PBCs, implementing mobile payment for small taxpayers (PBC 4) and
       reducing physical inspections of imported goods (PBC 5), encountered significant delays, primarily
       attributed to infrastructure deployment challenges.
      Restructuring No. 2 replaced these underperforming PBCs with new ones which were more aligned
       with the Government of Chad's (GoC) priorities and reform commitments. The PBCs were not
       aligned with the Government’s reform agenda, reflecting contextual, institutional and design
       challenges from the project’s start. While unforeseen events, such as the 2021 coup d'état,
       exacerbated those challenges, the decision to replace underperforming PBCs ultimately reflected a
       need for better realignment of project activities with the Government's priorities and reform
       commitments.

Component B. Technical Assistance to Strengthen Revenue Agencies (US$ 21.25 million, Revised
Allocation (1) US$14.25 million, Revised Allocation (2) US$ 5.75 million; Actual US$5.75 million): This
component had allocated US$21.25 million for Technical Assistance (TA) to bolster revenue agencies.
Specialized TA, with dedicated technical experts for each area, aimed to enhance transparency and
accountability in tax and customs administrations, particularly in petroleum revenue mobilization and
management. Component B was also intended to facilitate and monitor citizen engagement through
embedded surveys in tax and customs operations. Robust mechanisms were to be established to ensure
that the feedback received from citizens would be effectively acted upon.

The component originally consisted of five sub-components:

      Subcomponent B.1: Improve Tax Administration and Policy (US$5,350,000);
      Subcomponent B.2: Improve Customs Administration (US$6,000,000);
      Subcomponent B.3: Increasing Transparency and Accountability of Revenue Agencies
       (US$2,150,000);
      Subcomponent B.4: Address Fiscal Challenges and Improve the Oversight of the ICT Sector
       (US$1,500,000); and
      Subcomponent B.5: Improve the Management and Control of Revenue Generation in the
       Petroleum Sector (US$6,250,000).

Restructuring No. 1 led to a reallocation of funds from Component B to Component A (as noted above).

During Restructuring No. 2, Component B faced challenges with disbursement, with only 25 percent
(US$3.5 million) of the allocated funds disbursed. This was due in part to delays in procuring key contracts,
stemming from a complex national procurement process. Ineffective procurement and contract planning,
coupled with inefficient processes for preparing Terms of Reference (ToRs) and approving deliverables,
exacerbated difficulties, and delays. Additionally, there was a need for more ownership and progress in
Technical Assistance (TA) activities related to the petroleum sector. The management of the Hydrocarbons
Company of Chad (SHT) showed disinterest in completing the remaining audits and acquiring an
accounting and financial management system. Despite draft Terms of Reference (ToRs) and a firm in place
since December 2020, there needed to be authorization from SHT management to commence audits.


                                                                                                Page 3 of 35

    Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)



  Similarly, activities involving the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (MPE) as the beneficiary
  were progressing slowly, with an oil operations audit stalled at the contract approval stage for nine months
  (since March 2, 2022) without clarity on expected outcomes. As a result, these activities were dropped
  during the Restructuring No. 2.

  The modifications during Restructuring No. 2 involved simplifying the component scope and discontinuing
  underperforming activities, especially in the petroleum sector. Thus, the Restructuring No. 2 narrowed the
  scope of the project by:

        Removing direct project support to E-Tax and Accounting and Management Information System
         (IAMIS) as a result of the Government of Chad (GoC) decision;
        Dropping all key activities related to the petroleum sector due to the lack of demonstrated ownership
         and progress by the GoC; and
        Measuring the deployment of ASYCUDA World through the average time for imported goods to clear
         customs at (four) target custom offices instead of all customs offices.

  Additionally, Restructuring No. 2 introduced activities to incentivize implementation of the new VAT refund
  system and the publication of the annual reports on tax expenditures as key strategic actions outlined in the
  GoC’s PFM Strategy. In line with these changes to the project scope, all the PDO indicators introduced
  during the Restructuring No. 1 were replaced. At the same time, the restructuring maintained activities that
  closely aligned with the country's context, priorities, and the PDO to simplify component design and
  facilitate implementation.

  Overall, Component B was further reduced by US$8.5 million from US$14.25 million to US$5.75 million.
  This restructuring introduced three new PDO indicators (also PBCs), namely:

        share of large enterprises paying taxes through the banking system;
        share of approved VAT refunds paid through the new mechanisms; and
        publication of annual reports on tax expenditures for two fiscal years.

  Component C. Project Management and Coordination (US$ 1.75 million, Actual US$ 1.75 million): This
  component financed the Permanent Technical Secretariat of the Action Plan for the Modernization of Public
  Financial Management (ST-PAMFIP) — a dedicated Project Implementation Unit (PIU) – embedded in the
  MoFB in charge of planning, fiduciary, monitoring, and verification arrangements. The financing allocations
  for Component C remained unchanged at US$1.75 million during Restructuring No. 1 and 2.



e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  Project Cost: The project was estimated to cost US$35 million. The actual cost was US$29 million.

  Financing: The project was approved for US$35 million. The project was financed with an IDA credit of
  US$29,064,275.

  Borrower Contribution: The Borrower did not contribute any funds.

   The project was approved on July 6, 2018, and became effective on December 7, 2018. It closed on June
   30, 2023, although it was initially scheduled to close on November 2, 2023. A mid-term review (MTR) was
   conducted on 21 February 2022.

   The project underwent two restructurings:

   Restructuring No. 1: The first restructuring in June 2020 sought to provide support to: (i) GoC’s response
   to the COVID-19 crisis; and (ii) ensure business continuity of the tax and customs administrations and the
   treasury during COVID-19 containment. The changes were meant to mitigate against reduced revenue
   collection given that oil and non-oil revenues were expected to decline significantly in 2020. The level-two
   restructuring redesigned PBCs to address implementation bottlenecks and revise targets in line with
   implementation progress (ICR, p. 4).

   Restructuring No. 2: The second restructuring in December 2022, adjusted project activities, canceled
   non-performing activities of the technical assistance component (Component B) including those in the
   petroleum sector, and restructured the Results-Based Financing component (Component A). In
   Restructuring No. 2 an additional reallocation of US$2.5 million from Component B to Component A was
   approved. The overall project financing envelope was reduced from US$35 million to US$29 million as a
   result of the partial cancellation of US$6 million approved at the second project restructuring.

   The project closing date was also advanced in Restructuring No. 2, from November 2, 2023, to June 30,
   2023.

   The project concluded on June 30, 2023, having achieved a 100 percent disbursement rate based on the
   reduced financing amount of US$29 million.

   Split Rating: Based on the changes made during the restructuring, the project will undergo a split rating
   approach to assess its three objectives. In line with the ICR guidelines, a split rating will be applied as a
   result of the second but not the first project restructuring, which did not impact the project’s focus or
   ambition.

   The restructuring reallocated funds from Component B to Component A to address the funding gap and
   support the government’s response to the pandemic. However, while this reallocation may have shifted the
   distribution of resources within the project, it did not indicate a reduction in the project’s ambition.

   Restructuring No. 2, on the other hand, narrowed the project scope, removing support for certain activities
   and introducing new strategic actions. Consequently, all PDO indicators introduced during the Restructuring
   No. 1 were replaced. Thus, the project will be analyzed based on both the original project design and
   revised objectives/targets.

The project was designed to support the GoC in improving performance, processes, and transparency in
key government entities for revenue mobilization.

Economic Context: At the time of project appraisal, Chad was facing several economic challenges due in
part to external shocks, with negative impacts on economic growth and public finance. Being a large,
landlocked, and fragile country, Chad relied heavily on petroleum revenue. When oil prices plunged at the
end of 2014, the country went into a recession. GDP contracted by 6.4 percent in 2016, and was expected
to fall by 2.7 percent in 2017, compared to an average growth of 6.3 percent during 2013-14.

With a country score of 0.30 in the World Bank’s Human Capital Index (2018), Chad remained one of the
least developed nations countries in the world. Corruption scandals continued to negatively affect the state-
citizen relationship.

In the lead-up to the 2018-2020 period, Chad faced an urgent and persistent need to enhance liquidity and
secure substantial external support to address its financing gap. This required a significant improvement in
domestic resource mobilization. Government revenue, including grants, dropped from 23.2 percent of non-
oil GDP in 2014 to 14.9 percent in 2016. Chad had the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio in Sub-Saharan Africa at 4.7
percent in 2016, while oil revenue declined from a peak of US$2 billion in 2011 to US$200 million in 2015,
heightening the need for external assistance. The key challenge was to increase government revenue to
close the financing gap.

Given limited fiscal space and constraints within the Central African Economic and Monetary Community
(CEMAC), Chad relied on debt restructuring and support from development partners to address the
substantial financing gap. Despite receiving budget support from multilateral and bilateral donors, Chad
needed to defer arrears payments, secure additional external financing, or reduce expenditures.
Importantly, efforts were required to increase government revenue to close the financing gap. (ICR, p.
1). In this context, Chad sought to address key challenges relating to tax administration, customs and
revenue mobilization.

Tax Administration Challenges: Chad struggled with tax administration, impacting revenue collection.
Limited capacity in identifying taxpayers, collecting payments, and managing risks resulted in high
compliance costs. The incomplete implementation of the Standard Integrated Government Tax
Administration System (SIGTAS) and poor human resources management added to the challenges.

Customs Inefficiencies: The effectiveness of customs administration posed a significant hurdle to revenue
collection. In 2016, a Central African CFA franc (XAF) 140 billion shortfall in customs revenues, alongside
overlapping inspections and manual procedures, created opportunities for irregularities. These practices
increased costs for traders and caused delays in merchandise clearance.

Issues in Revenue Mobilization from the Petroleum Sector: Challenges in the petroleum sector included
insufficient oversight, limited financial management, and the absence of a cadaster. Weak internal controls
and limited experience hindered the Hydrocarbons Company of Chad's (SHT) ability to participate
effectively. The lack of a functioning accounting and reporting system, infrequent audits, and the absence of
a petroleum cadaster hampered the government's capacity to ensure the rational and transparent
exploitation of the country's petroleum potential.

At the project’s appraisal, there was a significant ambition to enhance the effectiveness of Chad's tax,
customs, and oil administrations. The primary goal was to reduce Chad's vulnerability to external shocks.
The project aimed to achieve this by digitally transforming processes and performance within the tax and

                                                                                                   Page 6 of 35

customs administration, with the specific target of increasing the non-oil revenue to GDP ratio. Additionally,
the establishment of effective reporting mechanisms within the Hydrocarbons Company of Chad (SHT) and
the implementation of a functioning petroleum cadaster were envisioned to enhance transparency in the
overall petroleum sector.

Alignment with World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF): The project was consistent
with the World Bank Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY16-20 objective of strengthening the
management of public resources and the 2015 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD).

In particular, the project sought to directly contribute to the priority of the CPF on "strengthening the
management of public resources." The project actively supported the enhancement of performance,
processes, and transparency in crucial government entities responsible for revenue mobilization. To this
end, the project's objectives included the computerization and modernization of tax and customs
administrations, along with the Hydrocarbons Company of Chad (SHT), through the implementation of e-
Tax, ASYCUDA World, and the Integrated Accounting and Management Information System (IAMIS).
These initiatives aimed at improving core functions and processes, encompassing aspects such as the
unified taxpayer registry, increased adoption of e-services by large taxpayers, mandatory payment through
the banking sector, gradual implementation of pay-by-phone for small taxpayers, reduction in physical
customs inspections of imported goods, and the establishment of risk-based procedures and audits. The
project's efforts were aligned with the goal of enhancing transparency, particularly through the
modernization of SHT's internal accounting practices and the publication of financial statements.

Alignment with GoC Strategy and National Development Plan: The project was also fully aligned with
GoC’s strategy and program, including Vision 2030, the National Development Plan (2017-2020), and the
Customs Performance Action Plan 2017-2021. Thus, the PDO of the project was relevant to the Country
Engagement Note (CEN) for Chad (FY23-FY24), directly contributing to enhancing citizen-state relations
and improving governance and transparency. The focus on a governance-oriented revenue administration
reform, as in PROMOGRI, had the potential to strengthen the state-society relationship and foster
development through improved fiscal management and citizen participation in tax reform initiatives.

Project's Contribution to World Bank Portfolio: Moreover, the project was anticipated to enhance the
impact of the World Bank's portfolio by complementing the fiscal consolidation program and the FY18-19
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series (i.e., the Chad-DPO Fiscal Consolidation Program approved
December 15, 2015 (P155480) and the Fiscal Consolidation Support Grant approved December 21, 2016
(P162548)). It offered targeted technical assistance (TA) and capacity-building support tailored to ongoing
initiatives, including those in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and oil sectors. The
project also extended support to the Treasury for improved debt management. Specific areas of assistance
included Pillar I for enhancing fiscal risk management, Pillar II for strengthening transparency and
management in the petroleum sector, and Pillar III for enhancing the contribution of the ICT sector to
inclusive growth within the Economic Recovery and Resilience DPO series.

The relevance of objectives is rated as substantial. The project adapted to remain relevant to the GoC’s
evolving priorities. The first project restructuring ensured the business continuity of the revenue collection
entities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the Restructuring No. 2 responded directly to the
specific objectives and actions outlined in the Public Financial Management (PFM) reform strategy. The
scope of the project was reduced to focus on activities that could realistically be implemented in the context
of Chad’s changing political environment. More specifically, it supported priority actions on revising the
legal framework, assessing, and publishing the tax expenditures as part of the annual Law of Finances (LF)

                             The original PD did not include an explicit Theory of Change (ToC) but provided a narrative on how the
                             development objective of the project would be achieved. The Restructuring No. 1 also did not include a ToC.
                             However, a ToC was incorporated into the project during the Restructuring No. 2 (see below discussion of
                             ToC in the context of revised Objective 1). The main aim of the PDO was to enhance revenue mobilization
                             through reforms targeting key government entities. By strengthening capacity and streamlining processes,
                             performance metrics within revenue collection entities were expected to improve.

                             The majority of the targets and actual dates for achievement (for all objectives, including objective 1) were set
                             for 2023. However, specific exceptions are noted.

                             The following two PDO indicators measured Objective 1:

                                        PDO#1 (original): Increase in Tax and Customs Revenue Collections relative to non-oil GDP (in
                                          percentage). The project aimed to bolster tax and customs revenue collection, addressing Chad’s low
                                          tax-to-non-oil GDP ratio through comprehensive reforms. Starting with a baseline tax-to-non-oil GDP
                                          ratio of 8.5% in 2018, the project targeted achieving a ratio of 15.3% (by 2023). By the project’s
                                          closure in 2021, progress was made, with the tax-to-non-oil GDP ratio increasing to 9.6%.

                             However, this original PDO was dropped in Restructuring No.1 due to challenges related to direct attribution.
                             The PDO needed to be aligned with the overarching PDO of the project, as it included revenue sources
                             unaffected by project efforts, such as property tax and oil sector revenue. Additionally, its target, set at 15.3%
                             compared to a baseline of 8.5%, was deemed unrealistically high, as econometric evaluations suggested a
                             more feasible increase of up to 12% of GDP through comprehensive tax policy and administration reform.
                             (Not Achieved, Dropped)

                                        PDO#1 (revised-Restructuring No. 1): Increase in Tax and Customs Revenue Collections relative to
                                          non-oil GDP (in percentage) – excluding property and customs revenue collection. Restructuring No. 1

       improved the attribution of PDO#1, replacing the indicator with a revised PDO#1 that measured tax
       and customs revenue collection, excluding property tax and tax revenue from the oil sector. The
       revised PDO#1 indicator reached 8.95% in 2022 (from a baseline of 6.6% in 2018), surpassing the
       end target of 8.1%. (High).
      PDO#2 (original): Average time for imported goods to clear customs. The original PDO#2 indicator
       measured the “average time for imported goods to clear customs” and was introduced during
       Restructuring No. 1. The PDO level indicator achieved the target of 12 hours (from a baseline of 24
       hours in 2018), and was reduced further to 4 hours by the project closing at target customs offices.
       (High).

In total, there were 3 intermediate results indicators (IRIs) related to Objective 1 (ICR, p. 46):

      IRI.6 – Share of imported merchandise subject to physical inspections: The indicator IRI.6, linked to
       PBC5-DLI5, aimed to measure the share of imported merchandise subjected to physical inspections.
       Initially, all imported goods (100 percent) underwent physical inspections (2017). The target was
       adjusted downwards twice: first, to no more than 65 percent by February 7, 2023 (as part of the
       Restructuring No. 1), then to no more than 80 percent by June 15, 2023 (Restructuring No. 2).
       Eventually, this indicator was discontinued as part of the PBC and instead monitored as an IRI.
       Despite efforts to reduce the percentage of imported goods subject to physical inspections, the target
       was not achieved, and security concerns continued to necessitate thorough inspections of all imported
       merchandise. (Not Achieved).
      IRI.1 (DLI#2). Share of food, necessity items and sanitary products imported to fight the COVID-19
       pandemic, as identified in Circular04/PR/MFB/2020, cleared through customs in less than 72 hours.
       The share of food, necessity items, and sanitary products imported to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,
       as identified in Circular 04/PR/MFB/2020, cleared through customs in less than 72 hours (in
       percentage) and surpassed the target of 60 percent. A baseline of 40 percent was established in April
       2020. The original target of achieving 60 percent clearance by December 31, 2020, was postponed to
       June 15, 2023. At completion (in December 2020), more than 98 percent of food, necessity items,
       and sanitary products imported to fight the COVID-19 pandemic cleared customs in less than 72
       hours. This achievement was crucial for Chad’s response to and protection of its citizens from the
       pandemic. (Achieved).

The following IRIs were dropped:

      Reduction in the Number of Physical Customs Inspections: Another target was to reduce the number
       of physical inspections (baseline 100%, in 2018) conducted by Customs authorities, initially targeting
       no more than 50 percent of imported merchandise by the original end target 2023. However, this
       target was dropped (during the first restructuring) as all imported merchandise continued to be
       subjected to 100 percent physical inspection due to security concerns, resulting in the target not being
       achieved. (Dropped, Not Achieved).

In summary, Objective 1 aimed to enhance performance in the recipient’s key government entities for
revenue mobilization. While achievements were observed in specific areas, such as the timely clearance of
pandemic-related imports through customs, challenges persisted, particularly regarding the reduction of
physical inspections on imported goods. Additionally, PDO#1 and the IRIs (e.g., IRI.6 and the IRI measuring
the number of physical inspections), were not effectively aligned with the overarching PDO, making it difficult
to measure their impact on domestic resource mobilization. Although PDO#1 was improved during

OBJECTIVE 1 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
To improve performance in the recipient’s key government entities for revenue mobilization.

Revised Rationale
The ToC aimed to address several problems related to revenue mobilization, primarily focusing on challenges
within tax policy and administration, particularly value-added tax (VAT) and customs operations. It was
predicated on several assumptions, including the belief that implementing a VAT refund mechanism would
incentivize compliance and boost VAT collection while strengthening capacity within the Ministry of Finance
and Budget (MoFB) would enhance tax administration effectiveness. Additionally, the theory posited that
mandatory tax payment payments by large taxpayers through the banking system and by small taxpayers
through mobile phones would streamline payment processes. Furthermore, it suggested that implementing
ASYCUDA World, alongside installing scanners, would improve customs operations and reduce manual
duties collection, with additional customs reforms, such as adopting risk-based inspection procedures,
expected to improve efficiency and revenue collection.

Operationalizing the VAT refund system and adopting risk-based analysis procedures were anticipated to
expedite refund processing and decrease potential abuse, supported by the publication of guidelines and
deadlines for VAT refund claims to provide transparency and accountability. The intended outputs included an
increased share of large taxpayers making payments through the banking system and small taxpayers via
mobile phones, along with the implementation of ASYCUDA World in selected customs offices and the
adoption of risk-based inspection procedures. Moreover, the plan involved training staff on the new refund
mechanism and operationalizing the VAT refund system, ultimately resulting in a reduction of imported
merchandise subject to physical inspections. These efforts were expected to lead to simplified tax payment
processes, enhanced compliance, and an increased share of approved VAT refunds paid through the new
system, indicating improved efficiency and transparency. Ultimately, the aim was to achieve improved
processes for revenue mobilization, contributing to increased domestic resource mobilization and sustainable
economic development in key government entities.

While the ToC outlined various strategies for addressing revenue mobilization challenges, it needed a robust
assessment of potential barriers, potentially overlooking complexities that could impact the effectiveness of
proposed interventions. These include underestimated capacity gaps, and unrealistic deadlines for PBCs and
indicators, indicative of a broader issue in alignment with the PDO statement. (See also discussion in Section
8 of this Report).

The outputs and outcomes described above were also relevant to this objective.

The following PDO measured the project’s success:


                                                                                                Page 10 of 35

      PDO #1 (as revised above): Collection of tax and customs revenue measured as a percentage of non-
       oil GDP (excluding property tax and tax revenue from the oil sector). As stated, an aspect of PDO #1
       was the collection of tax and customs revenue measured as a percentage of non-oil GDP, excluding
       property tax and tax revenue from the oil sector. Initially standing at 6.6% (baseline, 2018) and a
       target of 8.1% to be achieved by June 2020, this indicator was dropped (during Restructuring No. 2)
       due to issues with direct attribution. Despite surpassing the target at closure in June 2023 with 8.95%,
       similar issues persisted with direct attribution. (Achieved, Dropped)
      PDO#2 (Revised): Average time for imported goods to clear customs at targeted customs offices: The
       original PDO#2 indicator measured the “average time for imported goods to clear customs.” The
       revised PDO#2 measures “the average time for imported goods to clear customs at target customs
       offices.” The revised formulation and scope were due to the necessity to measure change in customs
       offices in which ASYCUDA World was planned to be deployed and which represented at least 50
       percent of imports. Focusing on customs efficiency, the project aimed to reduce the average time for
       imported goods to clear customs. Beginning with a baseline clearance time of 24 hours (2018), the
       project targeted reducing the clearance time to 12 hours (by June 2023). By its conclusion (June
       2023), the clearance time was further reduced to 4 hours at target customs offices, marking
       substantial improvement and positioning Chad ahead of CEMAC countries (High).

The following IRIs were dropped:

      Reduction in imported merchandise release time from 242 hours to 190 hours: The reduction in
       imported merchandise release time, associated with PBC6-DLI6, aimed to decrease the average time
       required to clear imported goods. Initially, the baseline (2018) stood at 242 hours on average to clear
       merchandise, with a target set to reduce this to 190 hours (by the original end target of 2023).
       However, due to the challenging context imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the target was
       dropped. Despite efforts made during the project implementation period, no significant change in the
       average time for merchandise clearance was reported, resulting in the target not being achieved.
       (Dropped, Not Achieved).

Overall, the revised objective 1 aimed at improving revenue mobilization processes in Chad, demonstrated
substantial progress, particularly in operationalizing the VAT and enhancing customs revenue collection
efficiency by reducing clearance times at targeted customs offices. Compared to the original PDOs, PDO#1
and the revised PDO#2 were better aligned with the overarching PDO; however, PDO#1 still
experienced direct attribution issues, and was ultimately dropped. Achievement for revised Objective 1 is
rated Substantial.

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
To improve processes in the recipient’s key government entities for revenue mobilization.

Rationale
The ToC aimed to address the challenges stemming from the lack of capacity and oversight within customs
administration, estimated to result in a shortfall of 2.3% of GDP in 2016. It proposed deploying an upgraded
version of ASYCUDA World in customs offices alongside the implementation of customs reforms. The plan
involved rolling out ASYCUDA World in customs offices and border crossings with high revenue potential,
with a particular focus on reducing customs clearance time for imported goods, including necessities and
products imported to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The anticipated outcomes included improved
performance for revenue mobilization and increased domestic resource mobilization.

The following PDO indicators measured the project’s achievement of Objective 2:

      PDO#3 was introduced during Restructuring No. 1. (The project’s original PDO level indicators
       captured only objective 1 on performance (increase in tax and customs revenue collection relative to
       non-oil GDP) and objective 3 on transparency (increase transparency of the SHT’s operations in the
       petroleum sector)).
      PDO#3: Electronic filing of tax returns by large taxpayers: The PDO indicator for electronic filing of tax
       returns by large taxpayers, initially set at a baseline of 0 (2018) with a target of 45 (to be achieved by
       June 2020), was introduced in Restructuring No. 1. E-filing introduced by the project was intended for
       taxpayers to file their tax declarations online. To this end, DGI has mandated the e-filing by regulation
       and has issued detailed step-by-step guidance on how to e-file.

Subsequently, the PDO indicator was dropped (in Restructuring No. 2) due to the need for more project
support for the development of e-Tax, reflecting a government decision, that led to misalignment with the
project's objectives. As a result, the indicator's status remains unknown according to the TADAT assessment,
ultimately resulting in non-achievement.

While the computerized taxpayers’ registry, initiated in July 2022 with the registration module of the e-Tax
system, represents a step forward, it has yet to encompass all taxpayers. Presently, only 2,940 out of a total
of 34,791 taxpayers have been integrated into the e-tax system. Completion of this process awaits the
finalization of ongoing data cleansing and the transfer of remaining taxpayer records from the old
Computerized Tax Management System (SIGTAS). (Not Achieved)

   Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)



The following IRIs were related to Objective 2 (ICR, p. 47):

      IRI2 - Establishment of unique identification number for enterprises for all administrations. IRI2 aimed
       to establish a unique identification number for enterprises across all administrations. Initially, multiple
       identification numbers were utilized across the administration (baseline 2018), hindering efficiency and
       coordination. The target aimed for all administrations to adopt the same identification number for
       taxpayers (by June 2023), facilitating streamlined processes. However, despite efforts to enact
       regulations defining responsibilities and procedures for registration, the target was not achieved at
       completion (June 2023), with multiple identification numbers still in use across the administration. The
       IRI on the establishment of unique TIN for enterprises for all administrations was not achieved. (Not
       Achieved).
      IRI4 - Number of customs offices in which ASYCUDA World has been rolled out. IRI4 aimed to roll
       out the upgraded version of the ASYCUDA system in customs offices. The original target was set at
       four offices (by February 2023, from a baseline of 0 in 2018), which was later revised to the same
       number, with the target date extended to June 2023. At project completion in June 2023, data
       revealed that the upgraded version had been implemented in 36 customs offices, surpassing the
       revised target. Additionally, during the mission, the government shared data indicating implementation
       in 45 customs offices, further exceeding expectations. The deployment is effective in several customs
       offices. Data for 45 customs offices was made available (ICR, p. 30). (Achieved).

IRI5 - Share of small entities paying Presumptive Income Tax for Small Entities (Impôt générale libératoire) by
mobile payment. IRI5 aimed to assess the share of small entities paying Presumptive Income Tax for Small
Entities (Impôt générale libératoire) via mobile payment. Initially, no small taxpayers utilized mobile payment
(baseline, 2018), with the target set at 20 percent (by June 2020). However, the target was revised to 10
percent (by December 2022) and subsequently discontinued as PBC#4 (during the Restructuring No. 2) to be
monitored as an IRI. Despite this, the actual achievement stood at 18.69 percent (at project completion in
June 2023), surpassing the revised target and indicating successful implementation. (Achieved)

The following IRIs were dropped:

      The PBC indicator measuring the share of tax returns processed in less than eight days (in
       percentage): initially standing at 50 percent (baseline 2018) with a target of 90 percent (by June
       2020), was dropped as processing times averaged 21 days during the COVID period, with no
       subsequent data provided, resulting in non-achievement. (Dropped, Not achieved).
      The target to support the gradual adoption of electronic filing by large taxpayers: as indicated by PBC
       2-DLI2, aiming for at least 20 percent of large taxpayers to file electronically (by June 2023) from a
       baseline of 5 percent (2018), was dropped due to lack of evidence during the TADAT assessment,
       resulting in non-achievement. (Dropped, Not achieved).
      Risk-based procedures and audits are adopted in tax and customs administration: The implementation
       of risk-based procedures and audits within tax and customs administration was a key target of the
       project. Initially, the absence of risk-based audits (baseline 2018) indicated a significant gap in the
       existing practices. However, through the project's intervention, risk-based audit procedures were to be
       adopted (by June 2023), reflecting a positive step towards enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in
       revenue collection. Unfortunately, this target was later dropped, signifying a setback in the adoption of
       risk-based approaches within these administrations, as highlighted in the TADAT reference. As a
       result, the goal of achieving risk-based procedures and audits in tax and customs administration was
       not achieved. (Dropped, Not achieved).

                                                                                                   Page 15 of 35

   Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)




      Ratio of risk-based audits performed on large and medium taxpayers: Another important target was to
         increase the ratio of risk-based audits performed on large and medium taxpayers. At the outset, this
         ratio stood at 0% (baseline 2018), indicating a lack of risk-based audit practices in these segments.
         Through project interventions, the ratio was to be improved substantially to 70% (by June 2023),
         demonstrating significant progress toward risk-based audit implementation. However, despite this
         improvement, the target was ultimately dropped due to the absence of risk-based procedures and
         audits in tax and customs administration, as highlighted in the TADAT reference. Consequently, the
         objective of increasing risk-based audits on large and medium taxpayers was not achieved. (Dropped,
         Not achieved).
        User traffic on the tax and trade information portals: The project aimed to establish tax and trade
         information portals to enhance accessibility and transparency for users. Initially, the target was to
         achieve 15,000 users on these portals (by June 2023) from a baseline of 100 (in 2018), representing a
         significant increase in traffic. However, this target was later dropped as no portal for users' traffic on
         tax and trade information was established. This setback resulted in the ultimate non-achievement of
         the target, indicating a failure to improve access to tax and trade information through dedicated
         portals. (Dropped, Not achieved).
        Mobile Rural Connectivity Operation Manual is developed: Developing a Mobile Rural Connectivity
         Operation Manual was a crucial target (to be achieved by June 2023) to expand mobile telephony
         coverage to rural areas. While the manual development was initially planned, it was later dropped
         from the project's scope. Consequently, the manual was not developed, leading to the non-
         achievement of the target. This failure represented a missed opportunity to enhance rural connectivity
         and extend mobile telephony services to underserved areas. (Dropped, Not achieved).
        Taxpayers' satisfaction with DGI quality of taxpayers' services: Ensuring taxpayers' satisfaction with
         the quality of services provided by the DGI was a key focus area for the project. Baseline data (2018)
         established through surveys indicated the need for improvement, with the target set at achieving at
         least 50% satisfaction (by June 2023) among surveyed users. However, this target was dropped as
         the DGI never conducted taxpayer satisfaction surveys. Consequently, the project fell short of its
         objective to enhance taxpayers' satisfaction with the quality of services provided by the DGI.
         (Dropped, Not achieved).
        Taxpayers' satisfaction with DGDDI quality of customs services: Similarly, improving taxpayers'
         satisfaction with the quality of customs services provided by the DGDDI was another important target.
         Baseline data (2018) revealed areas for improvement, with the aim of achieving at least 50%
         satisfaction among surveyed users (by June 2023). However, this target was dropped as customs
         authorities never conducted taxpayer satisfaction surveys. Consequently, the project did not achieve
         its objective of enhancing taxpayers' satisfaction with the quality of customs services. (Dropped, Not
         achieved).
        Improve the use of the Universal Service Fund (USF) to expand mobile telephony coverage to rural
         areas: Expanding mobile telephony coverage to rural areas through the effective utilization of the USF
         from a baseline of 0.00 (in 2018) was a significant target of the project. However, this target (to have
         been originally achieved by June 2023) was ultimately dropped, resulting in non-achievement.
         Therefore, the project failed to leverage the USF to improve mobile telephony coverage in rural
         regions, representing a missed opportunity to bridge the digital divide and enhance connectivity in
         underserved areas. (Dropped, Not achieved).

Overall, the achievement of the project's targets varied across different components and indicators. While
some targets were achieved, such as the roll-out of the upgraded version of the ASYCUDA system in
customs offices (IRI4) and the share of small entities paying Presumptive Income Tax via mobile payment

                                                                                                    Page 16 of 35

(IRI5), others faced significant challenges. Some significant targets still need to be achieved, such as the
establishment of a unique identification number for enterprises (IRI2). Several targets and PDO#3 were
dropped, indicating issues with achievement, target realism and misalignment with PDO. Overall, the
objective's rating is Modest.

OBJECTIVE 2 REVISION 1
Revised Objective
To improve processes in the recipient’s key government entities for revenue mobilization.

Revised Rationale
The outputs and outcomes described above were also relevant to this objective.

The following IRIs measured the objective:

      IRI (unnumbered) - Share of large taxpayers paying through the banking system: The goal of PBC3-
       DLI3 was to track the share of large taxpayers utilizing the banking system for payments. Initially, only
       20 percent of large taxpayers used the banking system (baseline 2018), but the target was set at 100
       percent by June 2023. Ultimately, the target was met, with 100 percent of large taxpayers making
       payments through the banking system, indicating achievement. (Achieved)

The following PDOs measured the project:

      PDO #5. Share of large taxpayers paying through the banking system: Restructuring No. 2
       upgraded this DLI as PDO to better reflect the project's outcome. The PDO level indicator (PBC 6)
       regarding the share of large taxpayers paying through the banking system successfully achieved the
       end target of 100 percent. It maintained this level throughout the project implementation period.
       Initially, the baseline indicated that only 20 percent of large taxpayers (2018) utilized the banking
       system for payments. The project's objective was to ensure that at least 70 percent of large taxpayers
       made payments through the banking system (by December 2022) and later 100 percent (by June
       2023), and this target was met. Ultimately, the project succeeded in attaining the desired outcome,
       with 100 percent of large taxpayers conducting their payments through the banking system (at the
       closure of June 2023), showcasing significant progress and achievement in enhancing financial
       processes and compliance within the taxpayer base. (Achieved. High).

      PDO #6. Share of approved VAT refund claims paid through the new mechanism. The
       restructuring introduced a new indicator, PDO#6 (DLI#8), focusing on refunding VAT credits through
       the new mechanism implemented in March 2022. This indicator measured the percentage of approved
       VAT refund claims processed through the new mechanism. Initially, no payments were processed
       through this mechanism (baseline 2018). The revised target aimed for at least 15 percent of approved
       VAT refund claims to be paid through the new mechanism (by June 2023). By June 2023, 5 VAT
       refund claims were issued, representing 15.79 percent of the approved claims. A payment order of


                                                                                                  Page 17 of 35

        102 million was issued on June 9th to refund VAT to eligible taxpayers. The PDO will be considered
        achieved after the central bank processes these orders.

This constitutes a significant achievement for Chad, which previously lacked a VAT refund system and had
never issued a VAT refund before, representing progress from a baseline of zero. It reflects a critical step
towards a well-functioning VAT refund system and demonstrates Chad's progress in legal, institutional
frameworks, and administrative capacity, directly supported by PROMOGRI. In 2022, Chad achieved a
significant milestone with the approval of Decree n° 0767/PCMT/PMT/MFB/2022, which aimed to establish
and streamline the VAT refund process. This decree ensured the refund of VAT credit through an escrow
account opened at the regional Central Bank, funded by 15 percent of various VAT revenues as per Article
891 (iii) of the General Tax Code. (Substantial).

Overall, the project made substantial progress in achieving the revised objective 2. The achievement of
targets related to the utilization of the banking system for tax payments and the establishment of a VAT
refund mechanism signifies significant advancements in enhancing efficiency and compliance, thereby
contributing to the project's overarching PDO. PDO#5 and PDO#6 were better aligned with the PDO.

OBJECTIVE 3
Objective
To improve transparency in the recipient’s key government entities for revenue mobilization.

Rationale
The ToC aimed to enhance transparency in key government entities for revenue mobilization by addressing
existing deficiencies, notably the lack of transparency and irregularities in tax expenditures, particularly in tax
exemptions granted in the petroleum sector. To achieve this, the plan involved publishing annual notes on tax
expenditures, including tax exemptions, and strengthening institutional capacity in tax expenditure analysis
and assessment. The publication of annual notes on tax expenditures and the training of staff in tax
expenditure assessment and analysis would facilitate this. The anticipated outcomes included increased
transparency in tax expenditure management, leading to improved transparency for revenue mobilization and
increased domestic resource mobilization.

The majority of targets and actual dates for achievement were set in 2023. However, specific exceptions are
noted.

The following PDO indicators measured the project:

PDO#2: Increase transparency of the SHT operations in the petroleum sector. This PDO was initially aimed
at enhancing transparency by ensuring the automatic generation of financial statements. However, this target
was not met as financial statements were not automatically generated. Despite efforts to improve
transparency, the project faced challenges, and the objective was ultimately dropped during Restructuring No.
1, being replaced by PDO#4. (Dropped, Not Achieved).

      PDO#4: The objective of enhancing the SHT's ability to produce financial reports from an Integrated
       Accounting and Management Information System (IAMIS) replaced PDO#2. Despite the replacement,
       the project encountered obstacles in achieving this goal. Although financial statements were

                                                                                                    Page 22 of 35

       eventually produced using the new IAMIS, the project did not support the system's development,
       aligning with a government decision. Consequently, the PDO indicator did not align with project
       support, resulting in the non-achievement of the objective (Not Achieved).

The following IRIs were associated with Objective 3:

      IRI 7: Adapt the functioning of the tax and customs administration to manage the COVID-19 crisis
       transparently. IRI 7 aimed to adapt the functioning of tax and customs administration to manage the
       COVID-19 crisis transparently. The plan included issuing 4 quarterly economic notes to the Minister of
       Finance and Budget (by June 2020), conducting communications to the public through radio and
       television spots, newspaper publications, and distributing quarterly letters of information. However,
       these activities were discontinued, resulting in the target not being achieved. The project encountered
       challenges in implementing these actions, leading to only 10% of the planned communication efforts
       being executed at closure. Despite the discontinuation of these activities, PBC 1, which involved
       quarterly communications, could not be dropped due to the disbursement of US$6.75 million. Thus,
       the project faced constraints in aligning with the current context, impacting the fulfillment of its
       objectives. (Not Achieved)

The following IRIs were dropped:

      Petroleum contracts were intended to be recorded in a cadastral system (from a baseline of 0 in
       2018), aiming for comprehensive coverage (by June 2023) to ensure transparency and accountability
       in the petroleum sector. However, the target was not achieved, as no progress was made in recording
       contracts in the system. The objective was dropped during the Restructuring No. 1, indicating a failure
       to implement the necessary mechanisms for recording petroleum contracts in a cadastral system.
       (Dropped, Not Achieved).

Overall, progress towards achieving Objective 3 can be deemed negligible due to encountered challenges in
enhancing transparency within government entities for revenue mobilization. Despite efforts, activities related
to managing the COVID-19 crisis transparently, establishing petroleum cost benchmarks, and recording
petroleum contracts faced significant obstacles, leading to the dropping of associated targets. Similarly, PDOs
aimed at increasing transparency in the operations of the SHT were not achieved, highlighting the persistent
difficulties in achieving transparency goals within the sector. Moreover, PDO#2 was too broad, and failed to
define how transparency would be measured.

The following PDO measured the revised objective:

      PDO#4. See above. Dropped during Restructuring No. 2. (Dropped. Not Achieved).
      PDO#7 (New, Introduced during Restructuring No. 2): Publication of annual reports on tax
       expenditures. The PDO level indicator (new PBC 9) on the publication of the annual reports on tax
       expenditures was achieved. In July 2022, the first semi-annual note on tax exemptions and the
       second one covering the period 2020-2021 were published on the MoFB website. This achievement is
       crucial in addressing the plethora of tax exemptions undermining Chad's tax system, with an
       estimated revenue foregone of US$277 million, equivalent to 2.7 percent of 2015 GDP. Establishing
       an inventory of existing tax expenditures, assessing revenue foregone, and publishing tax expenditure
       reports enhance transparency and accountability in public finances. This step is vital for broadening
       the tax base by streamlining and rationalizing exemptions, particularly in a country like Chad, where
       public transparency is limited. (Achieved, High).

The following IRIs were associated with the revised objective:

      IRI 7. See the discussion above. The indicator could not be dropped despite being irrelevant to
       changed context.
      IRI 8: The establishment of petroleum cost benchmarks initially faced challenges due to the lack of
       identified comparators. Despite efforts to address this issue, no comparators were identified, resulting
       in the non-achievement of the target. Subsequently, associated activities were halted as progress
       stagnated, and the project withdrew support for further development. Consequently, the target of

 5. Efficiency
Project efficiency is rated as substantial, fulfilling anticipated benefits outlined during appraisal. These benefits
include reducing time lost for customs formalities through digitalization, minimizing corruption, and enhancing
taxpayer identification. The successful implementation of these measures, particularly in tax and customs
systems, contributed significantly to a substantial increase in non-oil domestic revenues. Notably, tax revenues
rose by nearly 50% during the project period.

While it is acknowledged that tax revenues experienced a notable increase of nearly 50% during the project
period, attributed to process improvements facilitated by digitalization, it is essential to consider a counterfactual
scenario where other factors may have been driving the improvement in non-oil revenue performance. The data
presented in the ICR Graph 1, p. 37, indicates that non-oil revenue began to increase around 2015-2016,
predating the effective commencement of the project at the end of 2018. This suggests the existence of
significant external factors influencing the rise in non-oil revenue, which may include changes in economic
conditions, policy reforms unrelated to the project, or other structural transformations within the economy.
Therefore, while the project's digitalization efforts likely contributed to the overall improvement in tax revenues, it
is plausible that other concurrent factors played a substantial role in driving the observed increase in non-oil
revenue during the project period.

Despite the expected time lag for reforms to fully mature, the project's impact on revenue mobilization is
anticipated to continue beyond its conclusion.

Furthermore, the project significantly reduced transaction time at customs offices, from 24 hours at baseline to
just 4 hours by the project's end, generating substantial savings for traders. The savings generated from this
reduction in time, estimated through a projection methodology, demonstrate tangible benefits for the economy,
ranging from a low of US$8.96 million to a maximum of US$75.2 million by 2030, depending on different wage
levels and discount rates.

The project also played a pivotal role in digitalizing Chad's administration, particularly in tax and customs offices,
with achievements such as implementing the E-tax system and transitioning to the SYDONIA WORLD software
for customs operations. The cost-benefit analysis demonstrated positive outcomes, with net present values
indicating substantial benefits for traders, validating the project's efficiency, and demonstrating value for money.
At a 5 percent discount rate, the NPV ranges from US$8.96 million to US$75.2 million, with corresponding IRR
ranging from 23 percent to 75 percent, indicating substantial returns on investment. Similarly, at a 10 percent
discount rate, the NPV ranges from US$4.87 million to US$49.65 million. These figures underscore the
significant positive impact of the project, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing customs efficiency and
generating substantial savings for traders and businesses.

Additionally, the ongoing expansion and adoption of ASYCUDA World since October 2022 have shown
promising results, as evidenced by the increase in customs revenues by 8 percent in the first 8 months of 2023
compared to the same period in 2022. This trajectory could lead to substantial revenue gains for Chad, with
projected customs revenues potentially reaching CFA F 220 billion by the end of 2023. Overall, the quantitative
data underscores the positive trajectory of the project's impact on revenue mobilization and customs efficiency in
Chad, with promising prospects for further improvements in the coming years.

Lastly, project management costs were deemed reasonable compared to country and regional averages,

7. Risk to Development Outcome

The achieved outcomes, while demonstrating substantial progress in improving revenue mobilization
processes, customs efficiency, and modest progress in transparency within Chad's key government entities,
are under substantial risk due to several factors. Further progress is needed in revenue administration to
enhance performance, processes, and transparency for sustainable revenue mobilization. The 2023 TADAT
assessment identified areas for improvement in all nine performance outcome areas assessing core tax
functions. These are comprehensive and accurate taxpayers’ registry, effective risk management, supporting
voluntary compliance, timely filing and payment of taxes, accurate reporting of declarations, effective dispute
resolution system, effective revenue management, and enhanced transparency and accountability.
Additionally, the limited capacity and capabilities of the tax officials, coupled with frequent changes across
the entire tax administration, further undermine the performance of the tax administration.

Furthermore, the experience in fragile and conflict-affected countries such as Chad suggests that revenue
administration modernization reforms take time to implement and yield results, requiring consolidation of
changes brought about by the project. To address these challenges, additional comprehensive reform efforts
are needed, including expanding tax expenditure studies, establishing a more efficient VAT refund system,
and enhancing change management and communication activities.

There is ongoing discussion to implement a follow-up (PROMOGRI) phase II project, which could help
mitigate the identified risks by further supporting achievements in tax and customs administrations through
initiatives such as establishing a Customs Intelligence Unit and centralizing revenue streams within a
Treasury Single Account system. This follow-on program could also align synergistically with other ongoing
projects, such as the Digital Transformation Project and the IMF PFM Technical Assistance Program.

     Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)




a. Quality-at-Entry
  While the project was relevant to the Government of Chad's needs, its design faced challenges,
  particularly in bundling tax and petroleum sector reforms without sufficient synergies in a Fragile and
  Conflict-Affected States (FCV) context.

  Design shortcomings included underestimating capacity gaps and the sensitivity of the petroleum sector
  at the national level due to a lack of analytical underpinning, including a comprehensive understanding of
  challenges and political economy in both sectors.

  The project’s main design flaws were identified in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and target realism,
  lacking a clear results logic and closer alignment of the PDO statement with indicators. Initial deadlines
  for some PBCs were deemed unrealistic, and PBCs struggled to maintain relevance amid shifting
  Government of Chad priorities. For example, PBC4, focusing on implementing mobile payment for small
  taxpayers, and PBC5, aimed at reducing physical inspections of imported goods, both experienced
  significant delays primarily due to challenges in deploying infrastructure. Similarly, PBC 1 and PBC 3
  were replaced during the Restructuring No. 1 to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the 2021 coup
  d'état, ensuring alignment with government priorities in a changing landscape. Restructuring No. 2 aimed
  to replace underperforming PBCs with new ones (e.g., PDO#6 (DLI#8), focusing on refunding VAT
  credits), which were more aligned with the Government of Chad's priorities and reform commitments. The
  attachment of funds to PBCs provided an incentive for the Government to meet targets. By turning PDO
  indicators into PBCs during Restructuring No. 2, the project sought to link disbursements to the
  achievement of specific outcomes, encouraging the Government to pursue reforms and meet targets.

  Overall, Quality at Entry could have benefited from enhanced M&E support, including peer review by
  internal M&E specialists and World Bank Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS).



  Quality-at-Entry Rating
  Moderately Unsatisfactory


b. Quality of supervision
 Overall, the quality of supervision demonstrated strengths in responsiveness but needed to improve in
 promptly addressing certain project aspects. During the initial year of implementation (end 2018 to end
 2019), the TTL operated from headquarters, transitioning to a local presence in Chad and neighboring
 countries from 2020 to mid-2022. This on-the-ground engagement allowed for consistent client interaction
 and regular in-country supervision missions. Documentation of formal implementation support missions
 was deemed adequate, but the Mid-Term Review (MTR) faced delays, eventually taking place in February
 2022. Notably, project implementation significantly improved in the six months leading up to Restructuring
 No. 2, coinciding with the appointment of an experienced, out-of-country TTL. The World Bank Task Team
 enhanced supervision by incorporating thematic Short-Term Consultants (STCs) locally, addressing fiscal
 affairs and ICT needs.

 Despite facing challenges, the Task Team displayed proactivity and responsiveness during unexpected
 developments, initiating two restructurings in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and uncertainties in
 2022.

 However, notable critique revolves around the World Bank Team's relatively slow identification and
 corrective action on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) deficiencies, particularly in addressing sub-optimal
 petroleum activities, which may involve both technical and political considerations.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 The M&E design of the project faced challenges due to the absence of an explicit Theory of Change (ToC)
 at appraisal, which was only introduced six months prior to project closure during the Restructuring No. 2.
 This absence led to a lack of clarity in articulating PDO indicators, contributing to a key oversight in the
 original M&E design.

 The original PDO indicators were broad, had attribution issues, and had unrealistic targets. For instance,
 the indicator of increasing tax and customs revenue was set unrealistically high, and its scope was
 narrowed during the Restructuring No. 1. The original indicator of transparency in the petroleum sector
 needed a defined measurement approach. Iterative corrections during Restructuring No.1 and No. 2
 addressed these deficiencies, introducing more specific and measurable indicators.

 The iterative corrections made during Restructuring No. 1 and No. 2 aimed to address these deficiencies.
 The Restructuring No. 1 introduced two PDO indicators covering the outcome related to improved
 processes, and the broad indicator on transparency was replaced with a more specific one related to the
 production of financial reports by the Hydrocarbons Company of Chad (SHT). However, no progress was
 made on the associated activities, leading to the dropping of this indicator during the Restructuring No. 2.

 Additionally, the Restructuring No. 1 improved the attribution of the PDO indicator on performance by
 replacing it with a more focused indicator measuring tax and customs revenue collection. Nevertheless, this
 new indicator was eventually dropped in the Restructuring No. 2 due to incomplete attribution.

 Importantly, the Restructuring No. 2 introduced an explicit ToC diagram that unpacked the PDO statement
 into three distinct expected outcomes. This led to the articulation of revised or new PDO indicators that
 better reflected the evolved project scope. However, some gaps persisted; for instance, the measurement
 of improved performance was primarily focused on customs offices, neglecting other government entities
 supported by the project.



                                                                                                   Page 31 of 35

     Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)



 These refinements demonstrated the project's adaptability in responding to challenges and enhancing the
 M&E design to align more closely with the project's objectives and scope. The improved M&E framework
 aimed to provide a more accurate representation of the project's impact on the targeted outcomes.



b. M&E Implementation
  At the project launch, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) appointed a dedicated Monitoring and
  Evaluation (M&E) specialist and formulated an M&E manual. Throughout the project's lifecycle, M&E data
  collection and analysis adhered to the established methodology outlined in the manual. However, the
  M&E manual underwent only one update after the Mid-term Review in February 2022 and still needs to
  be revised following the two restructuring processes. Despite this, the overall M&E data collection
  arrangements were deemed adequate and managed by the project's dedicated M&E specialist, who
  collaborated with a network of focal points in the beneficiary structures.

  In February 2023, the PIU, counterpart departments, and the independent verification agent (IVA)
  conducted a crucial workshop to enhance clarity regarding the description and verification protocol for
  each indicator outlined in the Results Framework.



c. M&E Utilization
  The project's M&E framework, along with updated M&E data, played a pivotal role in guiding discussions
  during the two project restructurings and the Mid-term Review. The scrutiny of the Results Framework at
  these critical junctures led to revisions such as the cancellation of certain indicators, adjustments to the
  wording or targets of others, and the incorporation of new indicators to better align with the evolving
  project scope and objectives.



  M&E Quality Rating
  Modest

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The project falls under Category C and has not triggered any environmental and social safeguard policies.
   Since no building or repair activities were undertaken as part of the project implementation, it is considered
   to have had no impact on environmental and social safeguards.

   However, a notable omission is the absence of a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) throughout project
   implementation. The lack of a GRM represents a missed opportunity to gather valuable feedback from
   project beneficiaries, hindering the ability to make course corrections during implementation. A functional
   GRM could have facilitated the adoption of mitigating measures, enhancing the likelihood of achieving the
   project's expected results under optimal conditions.

     Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Compliance with the project's Financial Management (FM) procedures underwent fluctuations, with a
   Moderately Satisfactory rating in six Interim Status Reports (ISRs) and a Moderately Unsatisfactory rating
   in four ISRs. The initial and final ISRs both reported a Satisfactory rating. Following Restructuring No. 2and
   until closure, the FM rating improved from Moderately Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory, indicating
   progress in implementing recommendations, such as updating the accounting system, correcting
   budgeting errors, renewing staff contracts, and ensuring consistency in financial information across
   reports.

   Additionally, the fiscal year 2021 financial statements received certification without qualification.

   However, compliance with the project's procurement procedures, rated Moderately Satisfactory throughout
   implementation, might have been overrated. Despite efforts to mitigate risks, Chad's national procurement
   system weaknesses led to substantial delays, even with the recruitment of a procurement specialist, the
   establishment of a special procurement committee, and capacity training. The Project Implementation Unit
   (PIU) faced challenges in contract management and experienced delays in amending contracts to align
   with the project's new closing date introduced in the Restructuring No. 2.

12. Lessons

The World Bank's experience with the project in Chad highlights several key lessons.



                                                                                                      Page 33 of 35

    Digitalization and COVID-19 Response (P164529)



   1. Strategic project design with a sector-specific focus is crucial for effectiveness,
      particularly in FCV settings, as attempting multi-sectoral approaches can hinder
      progress and dilute efforts, as evidenced by the PROMOGRI project in Chad.
      PROMOGRI attempted to address too many sectors simultaneously, hindering progress. For
      example, engaging in revenue administration reforms across tax and customs, along with the
      petroleum sector, proved unrealistic and complicated. The project could have been more
      effective if it focused on distinct operations for each sector. Bundling sectors together within
      one operation deprived each sector of the necessary attention and policy dialogue. Progress
      significantly accelerated once the focus shifted solely to tax and customs reforms. This
      experience underscores the importance of considering sector-specific operations and
      avoiding misfitting cross-sectoral approaches, especially in contexts where effective reform is
      crucial.
   2. Effective digitalization in revenue administration highlights the critical necessity for
      governments to prioritize capacity building and expertise enhancement, underlining
      the crucial role of specialized skills in driving sustainable development outcomes. The
      success of PROMOGRI in Chad has underscored the transformative potential of
      digitalization, particularly within the areas of tax and customs administrations. This
      success has led the Ministry of Finance and Budget (MoFB) to prioritize digital initiatives,
      recognizing PROMOGRI as its most impactful project due to its sustainable impact. The
      concrete results achieved by PROMOGRI have not only increased the appetite for
      digitalization across the public sector but have also highlighted the need for Chad to focus on
      building a critical mass of specialists in core functions, enhancing technical expertise within
      tax administration, aligning tax studies with international standards, and refining procedures
      such as the VAT refund system to maximize development gains in the future.
   3. Future engagements in Chad should carefully balance technical assistance with
      results-based financing, taking into account political economy and operating
      environment considerations. The project design was informed by lessons from similar
      revenue mobilization projects in fragile contexts but needed more detailed sector-specific
      analysis and consideration of Chad's dynamic political landscape. While aiming to address
      critical challenges aligning with government strategies like the GoC Vision 2030 and National
      Development Plan 2017-2020, the design overlooked in-depth analytics such as TADAT and
      DIAMOND for customs administration. These analyses were conducted only after project
      closure, indicating missed opportunities to enhance realism and inform strategic
      engagement, particularly in the petroleum sector. A stronger analytical foundation and
      understanding of the political economy could have led to a more realistic design, including
      clear objectives and targets aligned with sustained government support and ownership.
      Furthermore, the effectiveness of technical assistance could have been improved given
      political blockages and procurement delays, emphasizing the importance of prior stakeholder
      analysis. Team composition is crucial in fragile settings, with a need for seasoned Task
      Team Leaders (TTLs), even if they are based regionally, supported by on-the-ground
      implementation support. However, cost restrictions and institutional expectations for full-time
      presence can limit such arrangements despite their proven effectiveness.
