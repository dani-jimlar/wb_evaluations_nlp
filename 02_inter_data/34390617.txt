2. Project Objectives and Components

DEVOBJ_TBL
a. Objectives
   According to the Financing Agreement (Schedule 1, p. 4), and the Project Appraisal Document (PAD, p. 6),
   the Project Development Objective (PDO) was to "establish the key building blocks of a basic national safety
   net delivery system and provide income support to households who are both extremely poor and food
   insecure in the Republic of Liberia”.

   For the purpose of this ICRR, the project’s PDO can be unpacked as follows:


                                                                                                  Page 1 of 21

d. Components
   The project consisted of the following three components:

   Component 1: Strengthening of the National Social Safety Net System (Total Cost: US$5.7 million;
   International Development Association [IDA] Credit: US$0.6 million; United States Agency for
   International Development [USAID] Grant: US$5.1 million; Actual Total Cost: US$3.66 million; IDA
   Credit: US$0.36 million; USAID Grant: US$3.29 million). This component financed the development of a
   social registry (SR) which included data as well as Management Information Systems (MIS) functions. It
   aimed to support (a) the development of a database architecture to house the SR, providing a single point
   for all social protection (SP) programs to access information about households and their vulnerabilities; (b)
   data collection and household registration; and (c) an eligibility screening mechanism to assess the poverty
   and food insecurity conditions of households. It also financed an integrated MIS for the social cash transfer
   (SCT) program that enables monitoring across participating programs as well as program-specific
   management modules for enrolment, payment, grievance redress, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), access
   management, and setting control.

   Component 2: Cash Transfers to Extremely Poor and Food Insecure Households (Total Cost: US$8.1
   million; IDA Credit: US$8.1 million; Actual Total Cost: US$9.04 million; IDA Credit: US$6.34 million;
   Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office [FCDO] Grant: US$2.70 million). Building on
   previous experience, this component funded income support to about 10,000 extremely poor and food-
   insecure households in Bomi, Maryland, Grand Kru, and River Gee Counties through regular cash transfers.
   It also planned to finance the implementation of accompanying measures aimed at sensitizing beneficiary
   households to the project’s objectives. In addition, the additional measures included raising the awareness
   of beneficiaries to adopt healthy nutritional practices as well as livelihood enhancing activities through
   educational workshops on (a) cultivating home gardens, and (b) increasing the food diversity and nutritional
   content in diets, particularly among children under five years of age.

   Component 3: Project Management and Capacity Building (Total Cost: US$2.0 million; IDA Credit:
   US$1.3 million; USAID Grant: US$0.7 million; Actual Total Cost: US$4.03 million; IDA Credit:
   US$2.93 million; USAID Grant: US$0.30 million; FCDO Grant: US$0.80 million). This component was
   designed to finance project management of the Liberia Social Safety Nets Project (LSSNP), including the

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 21

  procurement of service providers to implement the operational aspect of the SR and SCT programs. It also
  supported capacity building to key stakeholders involved in implementation at the central and local
  government levels. Finally, it aimed to strengthen coordination across relevant ministries and stakeholders,
  including providing relevant support to national, county, and district-level committees as part of
  implementation.

  The SCT was implemented in two phases: SCT Phase 1 in rural areas before the COVID-19 pandemic; and
  SCT Phase 2 in rural areas after the pandemic as well as SCT-COVID in urban areas.

  The LSSNP was restructured six times, including four times to extend the closing date of the USAID Trust
  Fund. Furthermore, the project underwent one Level 2 restructuring (which was also an Additional Financing)
  to extend the project closing date from 31 December 2021 to 30 June 2023. The changes were introduced to
  reflect (i) closing date extensions of project financing (ICR, pp. 60-61); (ii) changes to project components
  (e.g., introduction of the SCT-COVID assistance and expansion of SCT coverage) and related PDIs during
  the third and fifth restructurings (ICR, pp. 46-47); and (iii) replacing of accompanying measures on nutrition
  and home gardening with basic financial planning exercise (to alleviate operational complexity).

  Following is a summary of the six restructurings:

      1. In July 2019, the project was extended to allow continued utilization of the USAID Trust Fund.
      2. In July 2020, the USAID funding was extended to take into account delays caused by the COVID-19
           pandemic.
      3.   In November 2020, Additional Financing was provided to ensure that cash transfers and
           accompanying measures were provided over an adequate duration of a minimum of two years to
           extremely poor households. As a result, the Results Framework was updated, the project’s
           components were modified and a reallocation between disbursement categories took place.
      4.   In June 2021, the closing date of the USAID Trust Fund was extended due to delays caused by the
           COVID-19 pandemic and low implementation capacity.
      5.   In April 2022, the project was adjusted due to the reduction in FCDO’s co-financing.
      6.   In December 2022, another extension of the USAID funding was provided to allow two additional
           months to finalize SR data collection and for the PIU to perform quality reviews of the incoming data.




e. Comments on Project Cost, Financing, Borrower Contribution, and Dates
  The project was co-financed by a US$ 10 million International Development Association (IDA) credit (IDA-
  57910) and US$7.1 million in grants from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)

   and the FCDO. The initial FCDO commitment was approximately US$8.8 million (GBP 7,006,250) (ICR, p.
   6) of which around US$5.3 million were cancelled in April 2022 (ICR, p.17).

   The project was approved in April 2016 and became effective in September 2017. The delay of almost 1.5
   years was due to minimal decision-making prior to elections and changes in government administration
   (ICR, p. 17).

   The different financing sources’ closing dates were extended on several occasions. The Bank financing was
   extended in the AF/third restructuring for a total of 1.5 years, from December 31, 2021, to June 30, 2023.




3. Relevance of Objectives

Rationale
The project was fully aligned with the Government of Liberia (GoL) and the Bank’s strategies both at
entry and at project closing. Furthermore, it was highly relevant since it addressed the needs of the
population and was adaptable since it was able to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The project was aligned with the GoL strategies and sectoral policies. At the time of appraisal, the
project was aligned with Liberia’s national vision, Liberia Rising 2030, and the accompanying five-year
development strategy, the Agenda for Transformation (AfT), to promote its development goals. Specifically,
the project was in line with AfT’s Human Development pillar, which identified social protection (SP) as a key
aspect to address vulnerability and reduce poverty. In addition, the LSSNP was aligned with the National
Social Protection Policy and Strategy (2012–2017) (PAD, p. 2). Furthermore, the project maintained its
alignment with the GoL’s medium-term development plan, the Pro-poor Agenda for Prosperity and
Development (PAPD) (2019–2023). In particular, the project contributed to the priorities highlighted under
the PAPD’s Pillar 1 (Power to the People) which included the following (i) empowering women and girls; (ii)
ensuring SP for all, (iii) expanding access to health care, (iv) reducing vulnerability, and (v) mitigating
socioeconomic disparities (ICR, p. 9).

At closing, objectives remained fully aligned with the World Bank Group’s FY19-FY24 Country
Partnership Framework (CPF). Specifically, it responded to the CPF’s Pillar 2 (Building Human Capital to
Seize New Economic Opportunities) which highlighted the Bank’s program to “include social protection
activities designed to improve nutrition and educational outcomes and increase labor earnings among the
poor.” Furthermore, the CPF’s Objective 5 (Improved Earnings Generation Opportunities for Youth and
Women) mentioned the LSSNP specifically, emphasizing it as a priority to help empower women, among
others, through the provision of cash transfers to women who are heads of household or who are
responsible for household management. Finally, the project contributed to the World Bank’s global strategy
of reducing absolute poverty and promoting shared prosperity. Globally, the project was also in line with the
World Bank’s Social Protection Strategy (2012–2022), which promoted the development of an SP system
that is equitable, fiscally sustainable, responsive, and scalable. At the regional level the project was in line
with the Bank’s Africa Social Protection Strategy (2012–2022) which stressed the importance of
strengthening public agencies to share resources more fairly and limit the damaging consequences of
shocks (PAD, p. 5).

               Finally, the LSSNP proved to be adaptable and was able to respond to the COVID-19 by expanding its
               targeting to urban areas and reaching vulnerable households affected by the pandemic.

   4. Achievement of Objectives (Efficacy)

EFFICACY_TBL




                             OBJECTIVE 1
                             Objective
                             Establish the key building blocks of a basic national safety net delivery system

                             Rationale
                             The Theory of Change (ToC) held that by (i) designing and developing a database to house the Social
                             Registry (SR); (ii) collecting data and registering households (HH) into the SR; (iii) developing eligibility
                             criteria to assess poverty and food insecurity at the HH level; then a SR with accurate information would be
                             developed; would constitute the building block of an efficient Social Protection (SP) system; and would be
                             used as the single point for all SP programs in Liberia.

                             The ToC also held that by developing a Management Information System (MIS) which includes HH data,
                             modules for enrollment, payment, M&E, grievance redress, then an integrated MIS would be developed which
                             would allow SP programs to deliver benefits.

                             Outputs and Intermediate Results

                             An intake tool used to enroll HH into the Liberia Household Social Registry (LHSR) was designed to capture
                             the variables required to apply a proxy-means test (PMT) to estimate household consumption and to classify
                             HHs as either extremely poor and food insecure or not (ICR, p. 10).

                             The project developed and operationalized a MIS which included two systems: the Social Registry
                             Information System (SRIS) and the MIS. It also designed program-specific modules for enrolment, payment,
                             grievance redress, M&E, access management, and settings control (ICR, p. 10). As a result, payment
                             tracking records of all cash beneficiaries were logged into the MIS, thus exceeding the original target of 90
                             percent (ICR, p. 29). Furthermore, this allowed all grievance cases to be recorded into the MIS, thus
                             exceeding the original target of 80 percent (ICR, p. 30). Importantly, and to complement the grievance
                             redress mechanism (GRM), the project implemented Information, Education and Communication (IEC) to
                             sensitize beneficiaries on payments before and during the implementation of the project. These campaigns
                             were planned to ensure citizen-led monitoring of project implementation. In addition, the IEC informed
                             beneficiaries on the use of the e-payment system, the security procedures put in place to prevent and deter
                             fraud (for example, PIN code), and how to channel complaints regarding payments (PAD, p. 35). Additional

information on these campaigns, especially how they were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic,
would have been useful to include in the ICR.

Outcomes

As a result of the above outputs, the project established the first ever SR in the country - the Liberia
Household Social Registry. In addition, the project met the original target of registering 67,000 HH and the
revised target of 200,000 HH by successfully completing data records for 267,517 households from six
counties (out of 15 in Liberia), covering around 20 percent of the total population (ICR, p. 9). Furthermore, as
noted under Objective 2 below, almost 88 percent of payment delivery was timely, reflecting an important
aspect of system effectiveness.

Finally, three SP programs utilized the SR, developed under the project, as an intake tool. They include (1)
the SCT-COVID program, (2) the SCT-Phase 2, which incorporated the mobile short intake tool during
beneficiary registration and leveraged LHSR data from Bomi and Maryland Counties for its geographical
targeting, and (3) the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) program under the Recovery of Economic Activity
for Liberian Informal Sector Employment Project (P174417) which also adopted the mobile short intake
method (ICR, pp. 28-29). Moreover, and as documented in the fifth restructuring, with the closure of USAID
grant in December 2022, the project was only able to conduct social registry data collection at most in three
additional counties, instead of the original ambition to cover all counties. Lastly, the MIS is yet to serve other
programs outside of those with Bank financing, notwithstanding the issuance of the cabinet endorsement in
2020 for the LHSR to be used as the primary tool for targeting SP programs (ICR, p. 10).

OBJECTIVE 2
Objective
Provide income support to households who are both extremely poor and food insecure

Rationale
The initial Theory of Change held that payment of cash transfers, preferably to a female HH member in the
poorest and most food insecure countries and delivery of accompanying measures (e.g., nutrition awareness,
home gardening, financial planning) would lead to provision of beneficiary HHs with opportunities to adopt
healthy nutritional practices and livelihood-enhancing activities.

The ToC was later expanded under the SCT COVID phase which targeted urban neighborhoods and held
that providing cash transfers to urban areas - that were vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 due to high
density, lack of access to services, and informality - would result in greater economic resilience of urban
households (ICR, p. 9).

Note: In terms of long-term outcomes that were highlighted by the theory of change (reduced food insecurity,
poverty and vulnerability, ICR, p. 4), remain dependent on several factors that are beyond the control of the
operation.

Liberia was severely affected by the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014. As a result, gross domestic
product (GDP) growth declined from 6.8 percent per year to 3 percent per year, leading to an income
reduction of US$200 million. In addition to worsening households’ economic conditions, the EVD epidemic
resulted in nearly half of the Liberian household heads who were working in the first half of 2014 reported
being out of work by March 2015 (PAD, p. 1).

Furthermore, during the Ebola crisis, food security and child malnutrition worsened, with more than 90
percent of the households interviewed in the High Frequency Survey (December 2014) citing food insecurity
as an issue (PAD, p. 2)

According to the PAD (p. 40), constraints to improved health and nutrition in Liberia include (a) lack of
information on good nutrition practices; (b) poor access to nutritious foods, particularly during ‘off-season’
agricultural cycles; (c) competition between growing food for commercial markets and household
consumption; and (d) cultural practices that negatively impact the variety of foods consumed and methods of
preparation.

Outputs and Intermediate Results

Whereas the total number of households reached exceeded the target (see Outcome below), the total
number of targeted beneficiaries did not. Of the 115,117 beneficiaries that the project aimed to target, 105,
378 actually benefitted from the social safety net program. This is due to the average household size
estimated at the time of project design being higher than the actual household size. Similarly, and for the
same reasons, the sex-disaggregated targets were not achieved since the project benefitted around 42,000
women instead of the 57,588that were intended to be reached.

The percentage of targeted beneficiaries receiving quarterly cash transfers was 98.62 percent,
surpassing the target of 90.0 percent. Throughout the program's duration, this indicator consistently exceeded
its target by approximately 1-5 percent.

Furthermore, the proportion of payments delivered on time was 87.85 percent, exceeding the target of
75 percent. Timeliness of payments improved over the project’s implementation, reaching 100 percent by the
project’s closure. This is due to three reasons: (1) partnership with an experienced service provider; (2)
transition to exclusively providing mobile money payments; and (3) supporting beneficiaries in setting up
mobile-money accounts and providing them with mobile phones (ICR, p. 32). This indicator was also relevant
to the first objective since it measured the effectiveness of the safety net delivery system.

The project succeeded in surpassing the target (40 percent of HHs) receiving the joint financial planning
exercise by reaching more than 53 percent of HHs. This was a new indicator introduced during the fourth
restructuring (April 2022), and therefore implemented only in the SCT Phase 2. The measure was introduced
as part of a randomized impact evaluation embedded within the program. This indicator replaced two other
indicators which meant to monitor the additional measures related to home-gardening and nutrition: (1) Share
of cash transfer beneficiaries with at least one IEC session on home gardening; and (2) Share of cash
transfer beneficiaries with at least one IEC session on nutrition. The ICR states that this change took place
due to “operational complexity” in implementing the original additional measures without elaborating as to
what was the reason for the complexity. According to the project team, the joint financial planning exercise
was easier to implement because it was a one-time session whereas the accompanying measures related to
nutrition would have had to be provided every time to cash payments were made. This shift in focus in

accompanying measures was introduced to address the low capacities and the delays that the project was
facing.

Outcomes

According to the proxy-means test (PMT), around 85 percent of the households reached under SCT-
Phase 1 and Phase 2 were extremely poor. However, there was a difference between Phase 1 which
supported 3,451 households (HH) in two counties (Grand Kru and Maryland), 100 percent of which were
extremely poor, and Phase 2 - which had universal enrolment - and resulted in reaching 7,203 HH, 78.4
percent of which were extremely poor (ICR, p. 26).

The project was able to exceed its target number of HH beneficiaries. This is partly due to the
introduction of the emergency cash transfers in urban Montserrado as part of the COVID-19 response (known
as SCT-COVID) during the third restructuring of the project and which reached 14,855 households in urban
areas (constituting 58 percent of the total number of direct beneficiaries). However, when this result was
disaggregated by households with female cash recipient, the set target was not reached. Women
constituted 75.1 percent of cash recipients, falling just short of the target of 80 percent female cash recipients.
It is important to note that there was a difference between rural areas and urban areas. The SCT-COVID
emergency cash transfer program in urban areas had only 70.6 percent female cash recipients, bringing
down the overall average for the project. Furthermore, the breakdown was adjusted in the AF/third
restructuring to target a minimum percentage of female cash beneficiaries as opposed to female-headed
households (FHH) (i.e., from an initial 80 percent of HH being FHH, to 80 percent of project beneficiaries
being women).

In addition, the overall percentage of beneficiary HHs who were not facing severe food insecurity was
68.4 percent, surpassing the target of 60 percent. Whereas the overall share of respondents who were not
facing severe food insecurity was 42 percent under SCT-Phase 1, it reached 81 percent under SCT-Phase 2.
This outcome was measured through a PDM survey which was administered to a randomly sampled number
of recipient households following each round of payments. The PDM survey included the Food Insecurity and
Experience Scale (FIES) measure, which was used to track this indicator. The PDM asked respondents to
self-report their access to food of sufficient quantity and quality, with a focus on a lack of money and
resources to obtain food (ICR, p. 28).

Based on a random sample of beneficiary households who were surveyed, around 67 percent were classified
as having acceptable food consumption, exceeding the target of 60 percent. The post distribution monitoring
(PDM) survey captured various metrics, including the food consumption patterns of beneficiary households.
This indicator was measured using the Food Consumption Score (FCS) which included information regarding
the frequency of households’ consumption of items across different food groups within a specified reference
period. From these scores, households were then classified as having acceptable, borderline, or poor
consumption. The ICR states that the average FCS score for the sampled beneficiaries improved, achieving
72 percent under SCT Phase 2. The ICR does not elaborate as to whether this improvement is real or
whether it is due to the difference in poverty level between households targeted under SCT Phase 1 (100
percent extremely poor) and those under Phase 2 (78.4 percent extremely poor).

According to beneficiary satisfaction surveys which were administered after each round of payments
to randomly selected 10 percent of recipient households, almost 95 percent of beneficiaries were

                            highly satisfied. This was corroborated by the qualitative data gathered over the program's duration which
                            found that beneficiaries were highly satisfied with the program.

                            Finally, the ICR does not analyze the potential impact on the households’ nutrition status due to the change in
                            activities. However, based on the results of the impact assessment (which had not been finalized when the
                            ICR was drafted), the project team noted that the couples that had participated in the joint financial planning
                            exercise were able to improve management of their financial resources which contributed to improved
                            nutritional status.

    5. Efficiency
   A cost benefit analysis was not conducted by the project neither at the design stage nor as part of the
   ICR. Instead, the project’s efficiency was assessed based on several factors: (1) number of poor
   households reached (outputs); (2) adequacy of amount of cash transferred; (3) operational costs; and
   (4) efficiency gains due to systems put in place, such as the MIS and the LHSR. However, efficiency gains
   accruing to the system and/or sector should not be confused with the efficiency of the project itself.

   The ICR assumes perfect targeting (ICR, Footnote 31) and concludes that the project reached 36.1
   percent of the total extremely poor households within the selected counties. However, a more realistic
   approach would be to assume imperfect targeting. Annex 4 of the ICR provides such estimates and provides a
   range of extreme poor households reached between 25.2 percent (assumption 70 percent accuracy) and 32.4
   percent (assumption 90 percent accuracy). It is safe to assume that there were inclusion/exclusion errors – as is
   common in all social safety net programs – and that 100 percent accuracy is, therefore, not possible.
   Furthermore, the efficiency decreases if the number of individual beneficiaries (and not households) is



                                                                                                                             Page 9 of 21

considered since, as indicated above, the project did not achieve its target in terms of individual beneficiaries
reached.

The ICR includes the value of the cash transfer as a dimension of the project’s efficiency and mentions
that it was adequate at the design stage; however, the adequacy fluctuated during implementation due to
economic shifts, rising inflationary pressures, and the onset of COVID-19 (ICR, p. 12). However, the
amount/value of the quarterly cash transfer would be more accurately linked to the project’s outcome (efficacy)
since it would affect (i) the extent to which it was sufficient to cover the basic food needs of the targeted
households; (ii) the extent to which its value was predictable which would allow households to better plan their
consumption; and as a result, (iii) the level of beneficiary satisfaction.

Initially, the operating costs were high compared with similar projects in the Africa region (ICR, p.
41). With time, the project's efficiency improved and reached comparable cost-transfer ratios to other
countries in the region during Phase 2 thanks to decreasing the number of transfers to only four quarters
(instead of eight) but with the same total benefit amount as those in SCT Phase 1 (see ICR p. 6 and Table
below). The ICR provides a comparison of the LSSNP’s operational costs with that of other social safety net
programs in the region and concludes that they are comparable.

Using more efficient cash transfer systems improved the project’s efficiency. The transition from cash-in-
transit to exclusively providing mobile money payments led to (i) increased transparency, (ii) higher security of
payment delivery, and (iii) improved timeliness of payments which increased from 14 percent to 87 percent once
the service provider was brought on board (ICR, p. 13).

There were other aspects of implementation that significantly reduced efficiency, including the following:

Extensive operational delays slowed down the project, including, (1) effectiveness delays of 1.5 years (ICR,
p. 17), (2) slow government decision-making in approvals, payment delays, recruitments, etc. (ICR, p. 18), and
(3) implementation delays due to COVID-19, an exogenous factor and outside Government control (e.g.,
disruptions in the global supply chain delayed procurement, travel restrictions contributed to postponing LHSR
data collection, challenges in delivering cash in transit to SCT beneficiaries, difficulty for the PIU to
work/coordinate even virtually given network connectivity issues) (ICR, p. 17). As a result, the project was
extended by 18 months (ICR, p. 13).

Decrease in financial resources led to a scaling down of activities. In 2020, and as part of the third
restructuring, the FCDO’s grant financing allowed the SCT program to increase its reach to 12,500 extremely
poor households in rural areas and introduced a temporary cash transfer to 15,000 households in Greater
Monrovia under SCT-COVID. However, in May 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its

economy, the British Government reduced its official development assistance, including the cancellation of
US$5.3 million for the project. This resulted in scaling down some of the activities under Components 2 and 3
(ICR, p. 17).

Insufficient human resource capacity decreased the project’s efficiency. Several key project positions
(Financial Management Officer, Regional Coordinator, Operations Officer, and county level consultants) were
vacant for multiple months by the MGCSP, presenting a significant bottleneck to project implementation.
Furthermore, there was a high turnover of team members. This resulted in key procurement processes being
late, responses to audit and other recommendations being delayed, and an overstretching of the PIU due an
increase in the workload (ICR, p. 18). On the other hand, and as mentioned above, hiring an experienced
service provider to deliver the SCT program improved efficiency by providing additional capacity to implement
the project (ICR, p. 13).

Political transition delayed the project. During the 2017–2018 political transition, key members of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) were replaced, both at managerial and technical levels. This led to a loss of
institutional memory and slowed down implementation. In addition, with the new government, changes in the
Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection’s (MGCSP) were introduced which further delayed decision-
making (ICR, p. 17).

6. Outcome

The project’s overall rating is Moderately satisfactory. This rating is based on assessments of project relevance
(high), efficacy (substantial) and efficiency (modest). The project was highly relevant and aligned to both the
Government’s as well as partners’ - including the World Bank – priorities. It succeeded in achieving all of its five
KOIs and six out of seven of its interim indicators. However, the achievements of KOIs and IRIs masks some
important weaknesses, including not reaching the number of targeted individual beneficiaries, and the
interruption in the implementation of the additional measures related to improving nutritional status of
households. Finally, the project’s overall efficiency is modest, given that it experienced extensive delays, and

implementation costs were calculated based on number of households reached and not on number of individual

a. Outcome Rating
   Moderately Satisfactory


7. Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to development outcome is analyzed across the following dimensions: policy, institutional,
organizational, technical capacity regarding the strengthening of a social safety net system.

At the policy level, the project did not envisage any activities to support the development of a social
protection strategy. In addition, though the GoL’s approval of a new medium-term National Social
Protection Strategy had been included as a trigger for the Inclusive Growth Development Policy Operation
(IGDPO), the strategy was delayed by the COVID-19 outbreak, and the policy action was subsequently
dropped (ICR, p. 19).

Institutional sustainability was strengthened across two aspects. In January 2020, the Liberian cabinet
endorsed the LHSR as the primary tool for targeting SP programs and ensured the sustainability of the
LHSR (ICR, p. 10). In addition, the continuation of the National Social Safety Nets Secretariat guaranteed
that coordination meetings at the policy and technical level as well as the updating process of the National
SP Policy and Strategy would take place (ICR, p. 14).

Financial risk is substantial since the GoL has not yet approved a new National SP Policy and
Strategy that includes an adequate level of financing in the national budget. Furthermore, Liberia’s
fiscal space remains limited for investment in the SP sector and excessive reliance on donor financing puts
the sustainability of the country’s SP system at risk (ICR, p. 23).

Organizational strengthening - through the development of operational tools – is the aspect that is
most likely to achieve and sustain the development outcomes. The project developed several tools
which are being used and expanded by other Bank-funded projects. These include the following: (1) LHSR, a
consolidated database that allows the government to identify and target households in need of support; (2)
the MIS, which includes modules for all key processes of the SR and implementation of SSN programs,
including data collection, GRM, and M&E; (3) the PMT for better targeting; and (4) mobile money payments.
These functionalities are currently being utilized and expanded under the REALISE project (ICR, p. 44). The
Bank expects that the GoL will encourage their use for other programs after a more comprehensive
utilization under the REALISE project (ICR, p. 10).

Insufficient capacity building of government staff further increases the risk to development
outcomes. The project did not envisage from the start to train government staff outside the PIU. It was only
at later stages of project implementation that more proactive efforts to expand the number of MGCSP staff
included in capacity building activities to ensure ownership and continuity (ICR, p. 23).

Finally, whereas the ICR does not discuss the risk to development outcome at the household level in
SCT Phase 2, the halting of the accompanying measures related to nutrition and home-gardening,
likely increased the risk of households not adopting healthy nutritional practices. On the other hand,

                                                                                                  Page 12 of 21

the introduction of the couples’ joint financial planning exercise, likely improved intra-household
relations.




8. Assessment of Bank Performance

a. Quality-at-Entry
  The project’s design had some strong elements, in particular incorporating the lessons learnt
  from previous projects. These included the following: (i) strengthening community sensitization to
  ensure the targeting of the extreme poor; (ii) consulting with governmental and non-governmental
  organizations to ensure accurate transparent data collection; (iii) transferring cash payments on a
  quarterly instead of monthly basis to address the high cost of transfer; (iv) incrementally introducing
  information and communication technology (ICT) project implementation to allow for building the capacity
  to operate and maintain ICT processes (ICR, p. 16).

  The project was prepared in coordination with other donors, in particular with USAID which
  participated in the joint appraisal to ensure complementarity of USAID’s support to set up the SP delivery
  systems, such as the SR and MIS (ICR, p. 15).

  The project’s implementation arrangements included national level policy guidance and
  coordination as well as implementation and coordination structures at the decentralized
  level. The National Social Protection Steering Committee (SPSC) was headed by a national SP
  coordinator who headed the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). At the community level, the Community
  Social Protection Committees (CSPCs) were the key implementing agencies.

  Though the PAD identified the potential risks appropriately, mitigation measures were effective
  for some, but not all, of the risks. For example, the macroeconomic risks, including limitations on
  the country’s borrowing following approval, delayed significantly the project’s effectiveness. This
  was due to (i) a program with the International Monetary Fund under which the country had to wait until a
  subsequent fiscal year to sign the Financing Agreement (in view of borrowing limits); and (b) the GoL
  having to reorganize its borrowing portfolio since there was already an active World Bank-financed
  operation in the portfolio (ICR, Footnote 34).

  Similarly, the PAD identified inadequate institutional capacity and accountability mechanisms. To
  help mitigate these risks, preparation focused on providing technical assistance to implementing
  agencies to support implementation, investing in technical capacity-building activities, and relying upon
  in-country institutions (ICR, p. 16). However, the design could have considered from the outset the
  approach that was later adopted - intensive support from an experienced service provider.

b. Quality of supervision
 The following elements were considered to have contributed to the quality of the Bank’s supervision:

       Regular implementation support missions were conducted bi-annually (except in 2017 and 2020
        when there were conducted once). These missions were held virtually during COVID-19 restrictions.
        Thirteen Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) were produced and ISR ratings were
        adjusted to reflect challenges and progress in implementation.

       Weekly meetings to address technical, administrative, and fiduciary aspects of implementation.
        This allowed the provision of just-in-time and hands-on technical support to data management and
        analysis.

       A midterm review (MTR) was initiated virtually in mid-2021 and concluded in end-2021. It focused
        on continued implementation challenges and delays and new challenges: the authorizing
        environment at the MGCSP, liquidity constraints, and the adjustment in FCDO financing that
        resulted in a funding shortfall. Following the MTR, the fifth project restructuring was processed
        expeditiously to address these issues (ICR, p. 17).

       Timely processing of six restructurings, including an AF, expeditiously to address
        implementation issues and exogenous challenges.

       Implementing innovative solutions as challenges arose. The project team transitioned from
        cash in transit to mobile money payments to avoid delays in payments to beneficiaries due to weak
        capacity and unreliable cash-in-transit methods. Another example is the introduction of the couples’
        financing planning exercise during enrolment into the SCT program. However, the ICR does not
        elaborate on the operational complexity related to the additional measures (home-gardening and
        nutrition mentioned on page 7.

       Intensive implementation support throughout the life of the project. Given limited client
        capacity and the need to constantly play catch-up to achieve results, these efforts were often driven
        by the Bank team, including adjusting implementation schedules and implementation modalities and
        structuring the engagement with service providers. In the face of pressures to deliver timely and
        high-quality results under the project, the task team often had to lean into providing this intensive
        implementation support, financed largely by fundraising from TF resources, sometimes at the
        expense of much-needed capacity building (ICR, p. 25).

       Support in implementing the process and impact evaluations for the two phases of the
        project.

 The Bank’s continuous support to improve government capacity and innovate with service delivery
 arrangements helped bring implementation to a satisfactory conclusion (ICR, p. 17). As a result, though the
 project’s implementation efficiency was lower initially, it recovered with intensive implementation support
 toward the final stages of implementation.

9. M&E Design, Implementation, & Utilization

a. M&E Design
 Since the project was approved in 2016, the PAD did not include a Theory of Change which became a
 requirement only as of 2017. Nevertheless, the Results Framework and results indicators were closely
 aligned to the PDO and the underlying ToC. Though a ToC and associated assumptions were not
 developed for the LSSNP, the PAD included a detailed Results Framework, with sex-disaggregated
 indicators, which allowed the ICR to re-construct a ToC.

 Whereas the PDIs reasonably monitored outcomes (e.g., coverage, timeliness, satisfaction) as well
 as food consumption and food security), the PDO itself was limited to output-level objectives. The
 PDO could have been formulated in a way to capture outcome-level achievements. For example, to
 better monitor the PDO, it could have been formulated as follows: (i) “to establish efficient and effective key
 building blocks of a basic national safety net delivery system” which could have been monitored through
 the PDIs/IRIs related to an efficient/effective system (coverage, timeliness, satisfaction); and (ii) “to improve
 food security of extremely poor and food insecure households”, which could have been measured by the
 PDI/IRI related to food consumption and food security.

 Originally, the project intended to integrate a customizable M&E module within the MIS, which would be
 utilized by the cash transfer program and will be accessible for other programs to incorporate in their M&E
 processes (PAD, p. 35). With the delays in developing the MIS, the MGSCP established M&E mechanisms
 for the project and the entire SP sector and hired a dedicated M&E officer (ICR, p. 19).

 In addition, at the design stage, the project envisaged the implementation of two process evaluations to
 improve operational processes and support more effective SP coordination (PAD, p. 36) and to carry out
 post-distribution monitoring (PDM) after each round of payments. The process evaluations were meant to
 assess all the SCT and SR processes and determine whether they were being conducted as designed and
 to recommend any necessary improvements (PAD, pp. 35-36). The Bank team supported process and
 impact evaluation of SCT Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively (ICR, p. 20).



b. M&E Implementation
  The project had baseline information for all indicators (expect one). After two years of project
  effectiveness, the PDM surveys were administered to 10 percent of recipient households who were
  randomly sampled and collected basic information on households’ circumstances and experiences under
  the program, which was used to track this indicator (ICR, p. 28). The PDMs were conducted by a private
  firm (Third Party Monitoring) to ensure that bias is minimized (ICR, p. 20). The ICR does not mention




                                                                                                      Page 15 of 21

  whether there were challenges in administering the PDMs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project
  conducted one process evaluation as well as an impact assessment.

  The PDIs went through several revisions to fine-tune them (see Table below). During the AF/third
  restructuring, PDI 2 (share of cash transfer beneficiaries who eat at least one meal a day) was adjusted
  to “share of cash transfer beneficiary households who are not facing severe food insecurity” with a
  baseline of 24 percent. The original indicator was not well-defined for household-level measurement nor
  sufficiently reliable to measure changes over time. The revised indicator (FIES) is well-established and
  allows for measuring food security at the household level. Also, the breakdown of PDI 3 was adjusted to
  better track the gender of the cash transfer recipients rather than household heads who are often male.
  Further, the description of PDI 5 (share of project beneficiaries satisfied with project interventions,
  disaggregated by gender) was elaborated by specific aspects of beneficiary satisfaction being
  measured. In the third restructuring, the definition of PDI 1 was adjusted to clarify what constitutes a
  complete data record of households in the SR. (ICR, p. 6). The indicators for the additional measures
  were also adjusted to reflect the changes in activities implemented.

  The AF/third restructuring also adjusted the timeline for the end target to reflect the closing date
  extension and, for some indicators, the frequency and responsibility for data collection (ICR, Footnote 68,
  p. 49).



c. M&E Utilization
  The M&E findings informed the MGSCP, project management and Bank staff throughout project
  implementation. M&E information was used in several ways:



                                                                                                   Page 16 of 21

      1. Led to fine-tuning of the Results Framework indicators;
      2. Informed the project restructurings, and other changes in the project, including those related to
         decrease in funding;
      3. Guided adjustments to the project’s implementation schedule. For example, given the delays in
         effectiveness and finalizing key contracts for the SR and MIS, the MGCSP adjusted the
         implementation plan to roll out cash transfers in some counties in parallel to the development of
         the LHSR, thereby ensuring that benefits reached the most vulnerable counties faster; and
      4. Guided the design of the REALISE project which incorporated couples’ financial planning
         exercise based on positive qualitative and quantitative feedback from SCT beneficiaries.

  A payment landscape assessment fed directly into the transition of the SCT program to mobile money.
  Finally, the process evaluation led to adjustments of cash-out locations to ensure reasonable traveling
  distance by beneficiaries (p. 20).

10. Other Issues

a. Safeguards
   The project was classified as Environmental Assessment Category C and did not trigger any safeguard
   policies.

   The project established a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) which was incorporated into the
   MIS. This is considered good practice since, in this case, the GRM would be part of the greater M&E
   system and not a standalone function. The GRM ensured accountability and addressed issues, among
   others, related to errors of inclusion/exclusion, payments, missing or stolen SIM cards, and fraudulent
   reporting of household information. The GRM was in place and functional during implementation, and the
   GRM module of the MIS was being used to record cases and their resolution. The PIU received grievances
   on alleged cases of sales of LHSR identification cards in certain communities in one county and conducted
   further investigation, although with some delays. The issue was resolved by project completion, and
   mitigation measures have been put in place to be applied under the REALISE project (ICR, p. 21). In
   addition, shortly before completion, the Bank received two Environmental and Social Incident Response
   Toolkit cases, one involving a stolen vehicle and the other a motorcycle accident. The Bank worked with the
   PIU to resolve both cases (ICR, p. 21).




b. Fiduciary Compliance
   Procurement

   To mitigate the high-risk rating at appraisal, the project put in place several mitigating measures including
   the recruitment of an international procurement specialist, producing a procurement manual, procurement


                                                                                                    Page 17 of 21

   training and providing equipment (ICR, p. 21). Furthermore, Bank procurement staff in Liberia and Ghana
   country offices provided hands-on support on procurement and contract management including field visits
   (ICR, p 21). This regular support was essential in meeting the project targets. Nevertheless, the project
   faced several challenges including substantial delays in hiring the international procurement specialist,
   high staff turnover and an Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) investigation (ICR, p. 21).

   Slow procurement affected especially two of the largest project contracts (data collection and MIS
   development) which were key to establish the social safety system. Furthermore, the INT investigation
   halted temporarily the procurement process which could be finalized once the investigation was completed.
   After long delays, the systems were contracted and contributed to the achievements of system building
   outcome (ICR, p. 21).

   Financial Management

   In terms of financial management, the ICR does not mention whether interim financial reports and annual
   project audit reports were submitted on a timely basis or whether they were found to be of acceptable
   standards. However, it states that there were financial management challenges related to (1) delays in the
   submission of an audit recommendation implementation plan; and (2) instances of ineligible expenditures
   which include an unauthorized transfer from the project account for US$500,000, misuse of petty cash
   (US1,000), and USS$10,800 related to the FM Officer short-listing report which were reimbursed
   expeditiously by the GoL (ICR, p. 22).

   Finally, and similar to procurement, there were long periods where the Financial Manager Officer position
   was vacant between August 2019 and June 2021 ICR, p. 22).

12. Lessons

The ICRR confirms the series of lessons and recommendations emerging from the project’s
experience (ICR, pp. 22-24) The ICRR summarizes the most relevant lessons below:

Maintaining a balance between hands-on implementation support and building the capacity
of government staff entails a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Whereas, there is
a need to intensify implementation support during political transition periods in order not to slow
down the project, it is equally important that the Bank’s team support does not replace the need to
build the capacity of government staff. Improving efficiency should not take place at the expense of
ensuring effectiveness and sustainability.

Adopting a holistic approach which includes policy dialogue as well as capacity
building/training to accompany the technical aspects can ensure greater ownership and
sustainability. Focusing on the technical aspect of building a SP system and on delivering the cash
assistance is necessary; however, it is insufficient to ensure long term sustainability. Allocating a
budget for institutionalizing the SP and for ensuring buy-in through communication, policy dialogue
and training is key to improve ownership.

Having a flexible design, especially in Fragile, Conflict and Violence (FCV) contexts helps
limit delays. The project’s design did not condition the disbursement under one component before
the other. This allowed the project to deliver the cash assistance while building the SP systems.

Exogenous shocks can provide opportunities to pilot innovative approaches which could
later be scaled up. The COVID-19 pandemic allowed the project to pilot two new aspects: (i)
delivering cash assistance in urban areas which provided a “proof of concept” for universal targeting
in urban areas; and (ii) using mobile means to deliver the assistance which was replicated in the
second phase of the project in rural areas.

Removing potential access barriers facilitates the successful transition to mobile payment.
Technical support (e.g., through the provision of mobile phones, assistance to obtain SIM cards,
coordination with the mobile money operators, etc.) facilitated the introduction of mobile payments
and ensured that beneficiaries had access to the service.

Additional Note: The ICR missed an opportunity to draw lessons regarding some important
aspects of the project such as (1) implementation challenges in rural versus urban areas and how
they were addressed; (2) the complexity in implementing the additional measures regarding nutrition
and home-gardening and how they should be addressed in future similar operations; and (3) the

                                                                                                  Page 19 of 21

reason why other non-Bank funded social safety net programs did not utilize the MIS,
notwithstanding the issuance of the cabinet endorsement in 2020 for the LHSR to be used as the
primary tool for targeting SP programs (ICR, p. 10).

14. Comments on Quality of ICR

The ICR is generally well-written and provides a detailed overview of the project and available evidence support
the ratings. It has also included a clearly reconstructed Theory of Change based on the project’s Results
Framework which, importantly, includes key assumptions. Furthermore, Annex 7 includes several tables which
summarize concisely key information which makes the ICR both very concise and easier to follow. The ICR is
also candid and mentions the various integrity and financial mismanagement issues that the project faced. The
ICR uses evidence from the PDMs to support its analysis regarding the outcomes achieved regarding
improvement in food consumption, decrease in food insecurity and overall beneficiary satisfaction. In addition, it
is internally consistent and adheres to the ICR guidelines.

The ICR includes a good practice that of discussing the validity of the proxy-means test as a targeting tool. In
Annex 4, it points out that the PMT is subject to error and discusses how coverage of the extreme poor may
fluctuate given variations in targeting accuracy of the PMT.

Given the inclusion of urban beneficiaries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ICR could have provided
an analysis between the rural/urban differences in terms of targeting, implementation challenges faced and
differences in project efficiency.

Finally, the GoL approved the draft ICR report with no additional comments or edits to be included into the
report. For better planning of future similar social safety net programs, the government requested more
technical engagements to better understand the efficiency rates reported in the Economic Analysis section
(ICR, p. 45).
